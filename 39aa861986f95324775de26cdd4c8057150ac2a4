      "message": "I think we should avoid leaking RTP information outside the RTP layer. I know there\u0027s already timestamp_rtp, but I think that should be renamed to timestamp_90khz. I suggest you extract the parts of the RtpPacketInfo that makes sense for a VideoFrame and only attach that information to the frame. Most likely there\u0027s no need to attach one instance for each packet that a frame consists of on the RTP layer.",

      "message": "I agree that leaking RTP information isn\u0027t ideal.\n\nhttps://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcrtpcontributingsource is specced in a packet-centric fashion and applies to both audio and video streams. So I believe that plumbing a per-packet info, and doing the final assembling of the values very late (i.e. in `SourceTracker` when the output audio or video frame is on its way out from WebRTC), is our safest and most flexible option.",
