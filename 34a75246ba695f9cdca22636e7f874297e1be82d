      "message": "Since the purpose is to optimize the code, I would suggest not using the inner_product method. From my experience, the only thing that will happen is that it will inline a loop-implementation and no special optimization is done.\n\nHowever, with the current implementation the call to inner_product hides how the nested loop likes like (i is included in the call and end-iterators are used.\n\nMy suggestion is therefore to instead of using the inner_product write out the actual loops. That will make it more clear to see whether the loops are optimized fully.\n\nSame comment goes for the line 134.",
