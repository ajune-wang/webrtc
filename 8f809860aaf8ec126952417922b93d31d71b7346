      "message": "Restored now.\n\nI removed a couple of #includes here that are already in the header file. VideoDecoder is used as part of the VideoReceiver2 class declaration.\n\nHowever it\u0027s clearly been a while since I last reviewed this part of the guidelines. Wrt this part of the guidelines:\n```\nThis also applies to related headers - foo.cc should include bar.h if it uses a symbol from it even if foo.h includes bar.h.\n```\nI\u0027m pretty sure we don\u0027t follow that to a tee. Do you interpret it as an implementation of a previously declared function must also include the headers that must already have been included for the sake of the declaration?",
