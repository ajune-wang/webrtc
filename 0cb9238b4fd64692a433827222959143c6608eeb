      "message": "bitrate_priority can be any value, which is nice because it offers more flexibility than the web API.\n\nBut network_priority currently can only be one of the four values, which did strike me as a strange choice. I would have used an enum but I guess this was done for consistency (both of these use the same enum in chromium, which is then mapped to a double).\n\nDo you think this is worth fixing? Would be easier to fix it now than later, just wasn\u0027t sure if it was worth the effort. \n\n+thaloun (who authored the CL that added this)",

      "message": "I would go with double for bitrate_priority, and an enum for network_priority. Requiring an integer parameter to be one of only four allowed values isn\u0027t ideal, but works, e.g. with a clear doc comment + a CHECK. But the same for a floating-point parameter is problematic; we\u0027d be forced to either risk rejecting values that are very close to but not exactly equal to one of the allowed values, or build code that tries to guess what the caller means when they don\u0027t follow the contract exactly, which is a well-known \"road to hell paved with good intentions\" pattern in software engineering.",
