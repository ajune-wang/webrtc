Please note that the task is posted to a TaskQueue which itself is owned by the event log, so |this| should always outlive the tasks stored on |task_queue_|. For what it\u0027s worth, the existing code is already binding |this|: https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/22600/6/logging/rtc_event_log/rtc_event_log.cc#191\n\nI\u0027ve looked at the google and chromium guidelines and I can\u0027t find anything that discourages binding to |this|, but they point out the potential life-time issues when binding to pointers. They do discourage implicitly binding to |this| or other unmanaged pointers via [\u0026]() and \n[\u003d]().",
