The whole key managment is also using pointers... and while I am at it the unit tests are missing GCM128/GCM256 support and should be parametric enough which seems related enough.\n2/ is there a good way to ensure that this does not copy?\n\nMight be easier to review patchset-by-patchset but there is some churn in the unit tests wrt migrating them from a char[] to a buffer.",
