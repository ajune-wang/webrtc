# For changes to existing code that has no OWNER file, simply TBR= one of
# people below in addition to getting an appropriate code review. Generally
# third_party modules should have owners, so if you find yourself doing this
# more than once or twice for a directory, consider adding an OWNER file. If
# you're making changes and there isn't a more obvious person, the owner is
# probably you!

# Automatic round-robin assignment of reviewer for third-party licenses.
# No one receives email to this list, just use it as a reviewer.
