      "message": "I am in fact looking right now into referencing all buffers all the time, with different periods of update for each. Specifically, I was thinking of updating LAST with every frame, then GOLDEN every 4 and ARF every 8. I was also thinking of 1-8-16. I\u0027d have to experiment, really. That\u0027s a bit more involved a tweak, intended to improve coding efficiency rather than CPU utilization. As a quicker fix (given that I am trying to concentrate on another project), I think this s/kReference/kNone is good to land. Wdyt?",
