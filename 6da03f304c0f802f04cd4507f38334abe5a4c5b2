      "message": "Alternatively we could make AugmentedVideoFrameBuffer::GetI420() return its underlying implementation\u0027s GetI420() to allow GetI420() here, this seems wrong as well because it is not possible to override GetNV12() to do the same. I think this was always broken but that AugmentedVideoFrameBuffer was simply never used with anything other than MultiplexEncoderAdapter+VP9 and I420. For example if AugmentedVideoFrameBuffer was used with VP8 we would crash here due to GetI420:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/webrtc/modules/video_coding/codecs/vp8/libvpx_vp8_encoder.cc;l\u003d939?q\u003dlibvpx_vp8_encoder.cc\u0026originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F\n\nThe currently CL is consistent with what happens today (code always calls ToI420 instead of GetI420) but I think the right behavior would be to be able to do GetI420 here.",
