      "message": "I think we still want to address a few more things in the cxx17 file:\n- Many symbols are defined in multiple locations in the canonical STL I used ( https://github.com/PeterFeicht/cppreference-doc ). Could be fixed upstream, we could remove duplicate definitions if we agree on the canonical header to be used most of the time.\n- Some symbols like std::swap are used in too many places, should we remove them?",

      "message": "Because if you use `std::move(T v)`, you should use `\u003cutility\u003e`. For `std::move(T begin, T end)` that\u0027s `\u003calgorithm\u003e`. At the moment, IWYU will add `\u003calgorithm\u003e` for all `std::move` (any) usage, where we should have `\u003cutility\u003e` for most (all?).\nIt\u0027s possibly an issue for a few other usage, but I didn\u0027t try running and validating IWYU results for the whole codebase.",
