The reader will have to trace the initialization of the fields through each conversion point.\n\nIf there is a natural subset of a rtc::NetworkRoute that is persostent while other properties are not persistent, maybe it makes sense to refacotr it into two structs, one with the persistent state and one that has the persistent state as a member and adds the dynamic state as other mebers.",
