      "message": "The same parameter is called has_transport_sequence_number_id just below. If they\u0027re the same thing, they should probably have the same name.\n\nI\u0027m more widely wondering if having this bool-heavy interface makes sense, or if you should instead take the actual values in and do the comparisons within the function, so 0 would be \u0027unset\u0027 (which, I agree, is a wart as well). Perhaps there could be places where you don\u0027t _know_ the actual values, just that they are set? The four-bool-parameter functions below are the worst culprits, imo.",
