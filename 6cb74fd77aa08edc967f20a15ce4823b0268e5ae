      "message": "It\u0027s set and modified in packet, yes. But it also is used by SessionInfo e.g. here:\n\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/modules/video_coding/session_info.cc?q\u003dcompleteNALU\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d308\n\nLooks like this is the remnant of the old code. Removing it warrants it\u0027s own CL (need to also delete video_coding/frame_buffer.cc, video_coding/jitter_buffer.cc, video_coding/receiver.cc and video_coding/video_coding_impl.cc. Then, some of it is surely used by downstream projects.",
