Modern clients by default include a\u003dextmap-allow-mixed in SDP, while old clients are unable to parse this line claiming it must include 2 parameters.\nMore info about the issue: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/7z3uvp0-ZAc/m/8Z7qpp71BgAJ\n\nThanks a lot in advance,\nYura.",
