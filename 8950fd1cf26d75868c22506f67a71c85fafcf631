      "message": "Ufff, this was pain in the ass. I built the tests locally with ASAN and spent hours of debugging and investigating what is wrong. Then I just randomly removed the scoped_refptr variable causing ASAN to complain out of the PIPEWIRE define and it suddenty passed the tests.\n\nThis was because the tests were built without WEBRTC_USE_PIPEWIRE define, while WebRTC itself used it. I think the tests links against WebRTC, but they used the headers with different defines and this was most likely the issue.",
