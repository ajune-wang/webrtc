      "message": "It seems this happens if incoming frames are larger that what\u0027s configured for the highest simulcast layer (see ReconfigureEncoder).\n\nFor one, why are simulcast streams configured with a width and height, regardless of aspect ratio of the incoming video? The restriction should be passed on to the video source with VisdeoSinkWants, but there we only have a pixel count, no width and height.",
