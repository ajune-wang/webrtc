      "message": "Hm. Comment (and the fact that nothing breaks when you remove it) makes me wonder if there\u0027s something we\u0027ve not implemented here.\n\nThe envisioned scenario was something like\n\n- Negotiate bundles of media sections (A, B) and (C, D)\n- Multiplex SCTP on the (A, B) bundle\n- Stop A and B\n\nIn this case, the SCTP connection wants to be on the (C, D) bundle.\nBut I don\u0027t think anyone is using \u003e 1 bundle groups and stopping a whole bundle group in practice. So perhaps nobody cares?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know about this to understand how it would work and what this means. Could this happen at any time? Would DTLS be re-negotiated over the same ICE candidates (or different) and the SCTP implementation would be asked to simply switching to a different DTLS transport (I guess that\u0027s really what you\u0027re saying).\n\nThis isn\u0027t implemented now, clearly... And if we need this in the future, I\u0027m sure we can re-add.\n\nI\u0027m resolving this, but I have nothing to add - sorry!",
