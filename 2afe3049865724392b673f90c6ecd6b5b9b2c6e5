      "message": "Sorry for not being descriptive enough. The crash is in audio send stream which is configured with a non-positive max_bitrate_bps. I added test expectations that verifies that the proper max_bitrate_bps is set. There are already tests that sets the max bitrate with expectations, including setting it to 0 (which is the same as setting any negative value). Will update cl description.",
