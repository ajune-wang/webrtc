      "message": "RTC_DCHECK_RUN_ON holds a lock. It turns out that some of the Set*Transport* methods called below call back into JsepTransport after picking up another lock, thereby calling RTC_DCHECK_RUN_ON again - which tsan detects as a lock cycle.\n\nAdded a comment about that.",

      "message": "Because the return value is a raw pointer and not a scoped_refptr, this could be racy. After the lock is released, but before the caller does anything with the pointer (whether that is invoking on it or wrapping it in a scoped_refptr) another thread could clear the last scoped_refptr to it, deleting the object. The caller of this method now has a dangling pointer.",

      "message": "I\u0027ll see what the call graph says. It would be nice if this method could be owning thread only.\nThe pointers are all const std::unique_ptr, so they\u0027re guaranteed to stay around until the JsepTransport object dies.\n\nUPDATE: The pointer is not only returned to the signaling thread (in setLocalDescription and friends), it\u0027s stored in the BaseChannel as a raw pointer via a blocking Invoke() to the networking thread. Doesn\u0027t leave me with a good feeling. I filed a bug on it.",
