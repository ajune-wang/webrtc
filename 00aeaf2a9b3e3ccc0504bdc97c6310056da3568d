That way you don\u0027t have to go through any reviews but can own and develop your ADM as you like.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/examples/androidapp/src/org/appspot/apprtc/PeerConnectionClient.java;l\u003d451;drc\u003d4e86aa0870e5e34031a320e9ef95e86c897ffa4e",
