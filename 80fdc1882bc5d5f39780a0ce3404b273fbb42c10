      "message": "A lot of things worked together to let this slip by. The test in modules/ compared kHighLatencyModeDelayEstimateInMilliseconds to the delay estimate from audio_manager, which returns the full delay estimate, not divided by two. In sdk/android/ we don\u0027t have an audio_manager, so we compared with PlayoutDelay from the audio device instead, where the returned value should be divided by two. \n\nThe tests were put in after the /2 had disappeared, so it wasn\u0027t caught.",
