      "message": "I think it\u0027s better here than in the flags_compatibility.\nThis CL looks good but there is still an issue with the isolated-script-test-output flags:\nfuchsia test_runner expects \u0027-\u0027 when WebRTC tests expects \u0027_\u0027. So when the flags_compatibility is called before the test_runner, the test_runner fails and if it\u0027s not called the WebRTC test fails.\nNot sure what would be a \"clean\" solution here.",

The downside is that the fuchsia test_runner.py will not get the flag. Not sure that\u0027s a problem?",
