      "message": "actually the spec for inbound-rtp does not say the same things about RTX as the outbound one. Nor does it count retransmitted packets received. I assume this goes back to the time when we thought about not having RTX when the receiver does not know whether a packet is retransmitted or not. Shall I file a spec issue?",

      "message": "I think we still need a map because of Plan B, but I think we can do better than filtering on type, in both the sender and receiver cases. Remember, we only create \"codec\" objects if it is referenced by \"codecId\" from an \"inbound-rtp\" or \"outbound-rtp\". The the RTPs already know which codec, see the `info.codec_payload_type`.\n\nSo I think you can find the send/recv codecs that have a matching PT and ignore any codec where the PT isn\u0027t the RTP\u0027s PT",

      "message": "this is per channel so independent of plans (which are an SDP thing). A channel can still have multiple senders because of simulcast (really, a channel is a RtpSender, its sender is ... erm...).\n\nBut you are right, we can search for the receivers codec_payload_type. For video that doesn\u0027t blow up like it currently does for audio \\o/\nFor the sender that doesn\u0027t seem like the right thing since we\u0027d need to take care of the simulcast case and dedupe.",
