      "message": "This means we have different timestamp behaviours for sender and receiver frames right?\nIf I take an audio frame about to be sent, then re-write the rtp timestamp field in JS, the frame which actually gets sent on the RTP connection will have a timestamp of `my_timestamp - outgoing_start_timestamp + outgoing_start_timestamp  \u003d my_timestamp`, but if I take a received frame, re-write the rtp ts, then the actual sent RTP packet will have ts `my_timestamp + outgoing_start_timestamp`. Is this an issue?",

Then we can leave TransformableIncomingAudioFrame just in the .cc and avoid leaking the implementation details outside of the class.\nBut maybe that\u0027s then testing less - but it would be testing that this sender side can handle any frame which implements the TransformableFrameInterface which is maybe better?
