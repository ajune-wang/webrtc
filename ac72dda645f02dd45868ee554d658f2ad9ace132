      "message": "Hmm,yes we\u0027d have to do that in MaybeUpdateDemuxerAndRtpExtensions_w now.\nI did look into that though and seem to recall that there were a couple of other SDP checks that would check the same thing, which would cause the operation to fail. However, assuming that\u0027s the case, we should at least have a DCHECK here.\n\nDo you have an example test case that could fail? We could add more tests like SetRemoteDescriptionFailsWithDuplicateMids to cover that.",

      "message": "The most obvious test case would be duplicate \"a\u003dssrc\"s in different m\u003d sections. \n\nThere are also some unexpected situations where this can fail (where it really shouldn\u0027t), like if an SSRC was initially associated with a sink due to MID or payload type (via AddSsrcSinkBinding) and then another m\u003d section adds it explicitly in an a\u003dssrc. Here\u0027s a bug since I couldn\u0027t find one already, though I know it\u0027s been discussed in various comments: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id\u003d13623",
