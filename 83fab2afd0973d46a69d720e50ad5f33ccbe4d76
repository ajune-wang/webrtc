      "message": "This test didn\u0027t really make sense before. It says it\u0027s testing that the type of an existing network is updated after the network monitor is started, but in the real world the network monitor will *always* have been started before ConvertIfAddrs is called. Again, a case of the test calling private methods in an order that would never occur in reality.\n\nIdeally the test wouldn\u0027t be calling private methods at all, and would rely on faking the getifaddrs call, but that\u0027s a job for another CL.",
