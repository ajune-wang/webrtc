In the audio cl, there\u0027s a call to _rtpRtcpModule-\u003eGetLatestReportBlockData() from ChannelSend::GetRTCPStatistics, to get the latest \"snapshot\".\n\nIn this cl, we have an observer, which looks like a very different model. It seems the observer is called for each RTCP message, and then it has to be aggregated by the observer?\n\nIt would be preferable to have a single model for both audio and video.",
