      "message": "Increasing the keyframe size will improve the spatial quality - but there is also a significant risk of adding delay and stuttering on constrained networks. Sacrificing quality for latency is a conscious decision here. Any change of this nature would need to be gated by an experiment so we can verify real-world impact under a variety of conditions.",

      "message": "Agreed with Erik. Bigger frames mean higher delay. By settings optimal buffer size to 1 second you essentially tell encoder that it is OK to accumulate and keep 1s delay which is very high value for real-time apps (600ms, current default, is already quite high value).",
