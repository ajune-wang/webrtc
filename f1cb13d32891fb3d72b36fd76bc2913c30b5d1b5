Which is the reason to do RTX in the first place, see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4588#section-3 -- \"One approach may...\"\n\nFrom my testing we also have a problem with not accounting for RTX probes on the sender side (these are generated by a different layer). We count them on the receiver because we have no (good) way to tell whether a received RTX packet was a probe or not.\nWording adjusted slightly to \"it is therefore possible\".",
