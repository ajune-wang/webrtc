      "message": "I realize you\u0027ve just copied this from the previous code, but I think it could use a little clarification. Specifically, I had to look up the implementation of IsWindowOwned() to realize that (a) it was defined on the SelectedWindowContext, and (b) it means \"owned *by the selected window*\". That\u0027s an important point, because if the window was owned by any other window, it would not be correct to ignore it here, I think.",
