      "message": "We very often call these with std::string arguments, with manual .c_str() conversions. Could you make overloads that take const std::string\u0026 arguments too?\n\nAnd now we also have the option to use absl::string_view. It\u0027s not free to convert const char* to string_view (you need to compute the string length), but it should be almost free to convert std::string to string_view. So maybe we should have overloads for const char* and string_view?\n\nAlso, do we *ever* do anything with the return value other than compare it to 0? It seems like bool-returning functions called Str[N]CaseEq might be more appropriate...",
