      "message": "For safety, can we split this CL up? The first, uncontroversal one would implement the API but always trigger the keyframes at all the streams.\n\nThe second one would allow per-stream key-frames in some scenarios. It would be easy to revert later.\n\nI\u0027m not having a second thoughts about this whole idea. We also need to be very careful to not break the PLI and FIR processing, since some SFUs might rely on keyframes generated at all streams when they send a key-frame request on any of them.",

Complexity or something else?\nI can see the appeal of not needing to degrade all the streams based on something you have apriori knowledge will be useful on only one of them. I\u0027m not sure why we haven\u0027t moved in this direction for PLI/FIR already, assuming there is legacy baggage there. For a new API there should be no such concerns though?",

      "message": "There is actually a quite valid use-case for per-layer keyframes in a multiparty scenario. If you have someone new joining that is only prepared to receive the lowest resolution or if you have a single participant switching from a low resolution to a mid resolution you don\u0027t need big keyframes on the high resolution stream.\nIn theory this lowers the number of keyframes and increases the utilization of the available bitrate. How big the effect is in practice is hard to quantify upfront.",

But that will be a different API (and I suspect it will be convoluted because in addition to the ssrc in the packet it will involve the ssrc of the sender associated with it...)",
