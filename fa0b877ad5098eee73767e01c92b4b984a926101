      "message": "It seems a bit strange to me to have a unit of frames here, since the playout delay extension signals time in ms.\n\nIt would seem more natural with a max_render_delay_ms, or maybe even better with a timestamp with latest render time. Would be good to know how it interacts with the other frame timestamps, timestamp_us() and render_time_ms() below, I\u0027m not really familiar with how they are used on the receive side.\n\nMore abstractly, timestamps make sense as frame metadata, but a configured maximum delay isn\u0027t quite a per-frame property, is it?",
