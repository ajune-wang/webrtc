      "message": "nit: Since it returns a map of Connections, \"GetBestConnectionByNetworkIdPair\" would seem more accurate (and consistent with the rest of the method naming).\n\nAlso, there\u0027s not exactly a 1:1 relationship between \"Connection\" and \"candidate pair\"; a Connection can switch from having a host candidate to srflx depending on what it sees in a ping response, or prflx to something else if a remote candidate is signaled late, so it can represent multiple \"candidate pairs\" over its lifetime.",
