That\u0027s the technique used by e.g. absl::StrCat.\n\nAccording to https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/data, the version providing a non-const char* isn\u0027t available until C++17. How does absl::StrCat deal with that? const_cast?\n\nIf all else fails I could copy via an std::vector\u003cchar\u003e. But that\u0027s a bit silly. And there\u0027s no way to move storage between std::vector\u003cT\u003e and std::string\u003cT\u003e, right?\n\nI had no idea what kind of box I was opening here...",
