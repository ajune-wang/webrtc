      "message": "Please note that the config must be added to the build target that *defines* the symbol while the RTC_EXPORT needs to be added where the symbol is *declared*. This could be painful to maintain.\n\nIt is probably possible to add \u0027configs +\u003d [ \"..:internal_symbols_config\" ]\u0027 to WebRTC\u0027s GN templates since the \u0027configs +\u003d [ \"..:external_symbols_config\" ]\u0027 is used by the shared library. This should not be a problem since we don\u0027t plan to support sub-libraries and when !is_component_build the macro expands to nothing.",
