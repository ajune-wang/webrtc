      "message": "Hi Andrey,\n\nSorry it\u0027s taken so long, but I\u0027m finally getting around to this. First of all, thanks for the very high quality patch, the use of the key as both a unique identifier and an index into the list is pretty clever.\n\nA couple questions:\n\nWhy did you change DispatcherSet from a set to a vector? Is the idea that it should be rare for a lot of dispatchers to be added at once, and vector is more efficient for a small number of entries?\n\nAlso, I noticed an existing problem when looking at the \"processing_dispatchers_\" logic; if the dispatcher is actually deleted, it\u0027s not safe to add it to a \"pending removal\" list, because that doesn\u0027t affect it from being dereferenced. Using DispatcherInfoSet it was pretty trivial to deal with this",
