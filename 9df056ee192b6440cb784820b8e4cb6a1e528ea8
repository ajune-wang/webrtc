But that\u0027s still doesn\u0027t guarantee that for high resolution/big scaling factors there might not be any issues in the future.\n\nThe factors are supposed to be calculated in such a way that the resolution/scale_down_by is integer. So adding an epsilon is a standard way to deal with precision errors in that case.\n\nI\u0027ve added a comment on it.",
