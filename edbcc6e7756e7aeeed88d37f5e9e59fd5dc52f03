      "message": "I coded up a prototype of it, but I\u0027m not convinced to use it until we get resolution on a couple things.\n1) It seems to me that the runtime of this discussed algorithm is O(n^2). Worst case for every track every we loop through each remaining track that hasn\u0027t been allocated its max bitrate. This seems like a summation of n, for example with 5 tracks 5+4+3+2+1. The runtime of this would be O((n(n+1))/2)\u003d\u003d\u003e O(n^2). \n2) If this is the case- how important is the runtime? The amount of tracks should be low, although I don\u0027t see anything else \u003e O(n) in the file.\n\nOtherwise I think the algorithm is more readable and easier to understand. \n\nIf you agree that this is a problem then you can go ahead and review what I\u0027ve currently implemented. If you think it\u0027s worth talking about I\u0027m happy to chat when I get in tomorrow. I didn\u0027t finish cleaning up the prototype because of this.",

      "message": "I think O(n^2) over a small |n| is okay if we can\u0027t find something better that achieves the exact same behavior. If we expected big |n| values, we might have wanted to relax the requirements for the output, but |n| will likely be small, and the worst-case would also probably not be encountered too often even for that.\n\nMaybe we could talk offline again to explain to me how your algorithm deals with certain cases? I\u0027ll be available during our overlap today.",

      "message": "This is a good comment, and we should definitely keep it. I just think it would be good to move it. Whoever calls NormalRateAllocation (and please note that the function is private) likely cares more about the difference between ZeroRate, LowRate, NormalRate and MaxRate, than about the inner-workings of a specific one of those, and that with regards to only one of the logic\u0027s parameters (that is to say, there\u0027s also min, max, enfore-min, etc., but relative_bitrate is given preferential treatment here.",
