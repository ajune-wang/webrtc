      "message": "I think we should allow multiple RTT observers, maybe it\u0027s fine to have one target transfer rate callback.\n\nYou should be able to have a video stream without call object (and with some dumb bitrate allocator). Call object should be a lightweight orchestrator.\n\nSo I would leave it here (maybe move it class NetworkStatisticsInterface, and make MediaTransportInterface inherit from NetworkStatisticsInterface.",

      "message": "It maybe a minor point but I think multiple observers \"facilitates\" mistakes with ownership which spreads the logic. If fan out is really necessary, Call object can distribute.\n\nPassing Media Transport down to Stream in order to subscribe to RTT/target rate is something I think we should avoid. Stream should only get Sender/Receive media transport objects.\n\nCreating video stream without call object is OK -- you will still need to initialize high-level things and can subscribe to RTT and transfer bitrate.",
