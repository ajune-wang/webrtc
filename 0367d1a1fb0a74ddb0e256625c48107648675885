      "message": "Why do we ignore values greater than 20? Do we suspect the client that pushes this value might be buggy? IMHO, a value of 50 might be ill-advised, but it\u0027s up to experimentation to show it, right? I could imagine an ultra-low-bandwidth scenario where someone might really intend it. Or am I missing something?",

      "message": "The motivation of limit this to 20 ms is mostly because this adds extra network delay in case a packet is lost. This 20 ms is set to allow waiting for the \"missing packet\" if the packet was just out of order, in such scenario, we expect it just late for a couple of milliseconds.  \nThis field trial is not used at this moment. Feel free to experiment with this.",

      "message": "I understand the motivation for the experiment and think it makes sense. I am just wondering if it makes sense to prevent someone interested in experimenting with delay\u003d50 from doing so, by hard-coding a limit of 20 to the experiment. I understand that some hard-coded maximum value is good practice, but I wonder if 20 might not be a bit too low. Would it not make sense to set that hard-coded value to e.g. 500ms? If values above, say, 40ms are unreasonable, it\u0027s the responsibility of the experiment controller to keep values below that.",

      "message": "It\u0027s a trade off between whether wait and avoid re-transmission with the cost of extra delay or get a new packet asap with the cost of more bandwidth usage. During my experiment, the out-of-order packets would arrive within about 1-2 ms, so I think the probability that packet are late for anything more than 10 ms is very unlikely. It feels to me a delay more than a few ms would add more delay without much benefits. You could try out and see if in your scenario the packet out of order can be delayed for longer period and if a longer delay in sending nack would improve overall experience.",

      "message": "1. My question is not about the validity of 20ms specifically. I am asking - why should there be a hard-coded limit? Why is setting a reasonable value not entirely up to the setter of the experiment? (Except for patently faulty values, such as negative values, of course.)\n2. By the way, w.r.t the 1-2 ms out-of-order packets in the experiment - how was this measured? On a local setup, or taken from users\u0027 event logs?",
