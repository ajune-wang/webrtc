      "message": "For this instance it might make sense to use the define in send side congestion controller? Not sure exactly what behavior that is supposed to be tested here, so I figured that if 2.5 is expected it might be a good thing that these tests fail if the constant in send side CC is changed later on, just to provide some caution.\n\nOtherwise I kind of wonder if the tests here really should depend on pacer/send side cc handling of the pacing factor? Maybe it\u0027d make sense to use a mock instead, then the real default value of the pace multiplier would not matter. What do you think?",
