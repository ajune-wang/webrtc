      "message": "If we can guarantee that only the CN packets are \u003c2 byte, then this seems like a reasonable solution.\n\nFundamentally, there is a problem that we cannot measure the buffer size when we have DTX, which makes us think that we are under the target level. This could e.g. make us do preemptive expand right before we enter DTX because we think that we have a small buffer size. The buffer size measurement in https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/126761 should fix this except the case where the last packet is a CN packet.",
