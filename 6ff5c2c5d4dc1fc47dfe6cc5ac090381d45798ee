It\u0027s connected to audio_source_context_-\u003eSignalAudioMonitor, which appears to be called only from currentspeakermonitor_unittest.cc.\n\nSo I\u0027m a bit confused, before this cl, was CurrentSpeakerMonitor wired up to AudioMonitor in some non-obvious way?",

If you can wait until mid February, our last usage of cricket::CurrentSpeakerMonitor should be gone as a side-effect of deleting the pre-refactoring code.",
