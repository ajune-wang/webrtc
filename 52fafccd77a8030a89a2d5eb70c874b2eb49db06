Sadly, you\u0027ll have to address all the warnings.\n\nPlease run \"git cl format\" then run \"git cl presubmit -f\" and address any errors.\n\nFor example, it complains that sprintf is used in device_info_v3l2.cc, and snprintf should be used instead.\n\nI\u0027ve removed my LGTM so that I could reapprove it again after changes were uploaded.",
