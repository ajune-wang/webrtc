      "message": "I don\u0027t like putting \"for testing\" stuff in the public interface since we don\u0027t want to expose it outside of testing unless we can avoid it.\n\nCould this be moved closer to the implementation details? Perhaps \"for testing\" stuff can be set on the factory before creating the PC, or perhaps the \"for testing\" bit can be to invoke OnMessage() directly, faking that the PostDelayedTask happened.\n\nThere are peerconnection_*_unittest.cc that explicitly grab the \"internal\" PC, for stuff not in the public interface. Move the test?\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/search/?q\u003df:peerconnection+f:unittest+Internal\u0026type\u003dcs",
