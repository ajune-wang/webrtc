      "message": "This isn\u0027t ready for review quite yet, still need to clean some stuff up and add tests. Just wanted to gather feedback on the concept first.\n\nI think it\u0027s a very good idea to make usrsctp operate on a single thread to insulate us against further race condition bugs. There are a few options I can think of each with some downside:\n\n1. Use network thread as usrsctp timer thread (this CL)\n\n   Cons: Doesn\u0027t work if two PeerConnectionFactories use different network threads, but that should only happen in a test environment anyway (right?). Should work at least for chromium and every user of the mobile SDKs.\n\n2. Use new standalone thread for timer operations, wrapping usrsctp_handle_timers in a global mutex.\n\n   Cons: Introduces yet another mutex, on top of the ones that usrsctp uses internally. Also, would we use this mutex for every method or just usrsctp_handle_timers/usrsctp_close?\n\n3. Use new standalone thread, piping *all* usrsctp operations (including usrsctp_sendv, usrsctp_conninput) through it.\n\n   Cons: Additional threading complexity; makes every send operation even more delayed because it must go from the network thread to the usrsctp thread and back again.\n\n\n\nThoughts? Any other options I may be overlooking?",
