      "message": "So this doesn\u0027t work because we\u0027re trying to add the media section (that got detached from the description because the section was rejected) with mid 0 to a description that already contains mid 0?\n\nThis seems to indicate that when a section is rejected, the binding of the transceiver to the MID should also be dissolved, so that a new non-conflicting MID will be generated when trying to attach the transceiver to a new place in the SDP.\n\nBut this CL makes life better, so approving.",

      "message": "Correct, the existing mid should cease to exist when the m-line gets rejected which it apparently does not. This seems to be the expectation from the one branch of the DCHECK: current_content-\u003ename !\u003d media_description_options.mid\n\nI think it is more pragmatic to forbid mid reuse and consider mid a counter. See question forwarded to avtcore.\n\nBut hey, we don\u0027t crash anymore but return a \"stop trying to do this\"",
