      "message": "A very expensive thing to do for such a small thing. There are reports of calling getStats() or not being the difference between the fan making a sound or not (not sure which application).\nPreferably getStats() should only be called every 5-10 seconds.\n\nRehashing an old conversation, but: Is WebAudio too expensive? There was an issue about exposing different levels directly on MediaStreamTracks (https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/issues/523) but nobody\u0027s owning/driving it.",
