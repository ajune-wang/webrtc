      "message": "Would it be possible to make this GetAdaptDownToTargetResolution(int target_pixels)?\n\nConsidering the use case for this method is \"don\u0027t send frames larger than X in certain circumstances\" I think the method signature should reflect that. And ideally the calling place, instead of doing maybe-adapts for the first five frames or whatever, if the calling place simply jumped to the desired target based on bitrate and encoder configs, I think that would do what is intended, and we could do a single ApplyAdaptation step rather than 0-10 adaptations spread out over 5 method calls.\n\nThe only upside with the old code is that after the first 5 frames we know that this scary part of the code will not get executed again, so if it does something whacky, it would only do so at the start. But I think that if we can adapt to the desired target immediately, then we can change the initial frame dropper counter from an int to a boolean - we only trigger it once?\n\nIn either case, please add a comment what the method is doing.",
