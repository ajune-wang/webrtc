      "message": "I don\u0027t think this will help with the crash:\n\n`StopPipeWire()` stops the PipeWire mainloop immediately. This does not tigger `OnCoreDone()`. `OnCoreDone()` is called when the server responds to a sync message.\n\nStopping the main loop includes waiting for any pending events to be handled. To it may look like it causes the event. But it\u0027s just a coincidence.\n\nSo I expect the race happens just before that. If `callback_` is deleted before `PipeWireSession` then you need stop the PipeWire stuff first.\nMaybe in addition to this change, make `Cleanup()` public and call it in the destructor of the `callback_` object or something like that.",
