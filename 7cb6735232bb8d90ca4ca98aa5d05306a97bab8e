      "message": "I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s an easy or hard change, but I think it would be a lot better we could just delete the conversion code in VideoStreamEncoder (including the supports_native_handle thing), and leave to the encoder implementations to call ToI420 if they don\u0027t support the original format. If you agree, at least plan for that, even if you need this in the interim.",

      "message": "Could you remove supports_native_handle? I mean prepare for deletion (set supported formats for all sw encoders and mark native handle as deprecated).\nOr at least make a todo now to delete it. It makes little sense to have two parallel systems to signal supported format.\n\nI assume there are quite some downstream projects using native_handle now, so a 3 step process is needed to clean it all out. But I\u0027m fine with it being a separate CL.",
