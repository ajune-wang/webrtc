I believe I tried to do something similar when changing the AudioEncoder API a while back and that I had to create a method with a new name, instead of overloading, so avoid breakage.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s a bit scary that they\u0027re calling each other, unless the subclass implements one of them. (Which, I admit, any existing subclass must, since the previous one was pure virtual.)",
