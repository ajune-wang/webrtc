      "message": "It was because the signalable_candidates defined here could be empty, and a candidate from an any address port was signalable if it passed CheckCandidateFilter in an earlier place where MaybeSignalCandidateReady was called. A case then would be the any address port is a TCP port that has no signalable candidates yet (is_any_ip is true in your CL), but no other ports bounded to enumerated networks seem to work (\"ready\" defined here; also, sorry that I should have just checked ips_from_non_any_address_ports.empty() and has_ready_ports_bound_to_enumerated_networks is equivalent but confusing). In this case, we still signal this port, and no candidates from it would be signaled though. This is equivalent to is_any_ip and ips_from_non_any_address_ports.empty() both true in your CL, which is followed by signaling the port but not the candidate since the candidate does not pass the filter.\n\nI like the way you coded in the fork CL on this part, and the comments there make the reasoning clearer. Will merge your change. Thanks!",
