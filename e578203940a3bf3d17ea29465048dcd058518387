      "message": "PCF deps is injected to the factory (\u003d same for all PCs) whereas PC deps is injected on a per-PC basis?\n\nThat makes sense: there should only be one metronome per context (iframe/factory). But how do you plan to inject the metronome reference to the actual peer connection?\n\nWill you pass down a raw pointer because ownership is held by the factory, or will you end up having to create a unique_ptr\u003c\u003e and thus ultimately have it inside of the PC deps anyway?",
