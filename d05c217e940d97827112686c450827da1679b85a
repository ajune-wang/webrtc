      "message": "Hm. I\u0027m not sure I understand.\n\nFrom the description in RFC 4588, I read this as saying that rtx-time gives the time by which it doesn\u0027t make sense to send NAK any more, because the sender will have thrown away the packet from its possible-retransmit buffers. So at that point, the receiver should request a keyframe rather than sending a packet NACK.\n\nIn the interval \u003cexpected arrival time, expected arrival time + rtx-time - RTT/2\u003e, it makes sense to send NACK and hope to get a retransmission, avoiding the need to request a new keyframe. Or, if redundant encoding is in use, just wait and hope that the gap will be covered by a redundant transmission.\n\nBut I don\u0027t understand what the actual effect of specifying rtx-time is in this CL.\n\nApart from that, nits.",
