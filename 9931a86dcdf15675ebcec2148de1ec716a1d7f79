      "message": "Since audioDeviceModule is a native component and we don\u0027t plan to wrap it and provide an ObjC API, I would like to only add interfaces for it in RTCPeerConnectionFactory+Native.h and not expose it in the pure ObjC API. \n\nYour app is allowed to include sdk/objc/Framework/Classes/PeerConnection/RTCPeerConnectionFactory+Native.h. We might move these native ObjC++ headers to a more suitable location later and make it clear you can depend on them, but we won\u0027t break backwards compatibility and we\u0027ll help update your app if needed.",
