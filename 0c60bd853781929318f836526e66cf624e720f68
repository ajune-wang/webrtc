      "message": "nit: it\u0027s more common in the code base to use an early return for these sort of cases. i.e.\n\n```\nif (!data)\n  return;\n```\n\nActually, I wonder if we should have a dcheck for this too? Just to alert developers. Another thing we could do is to dcheck that the size is 0 if data is nullptr. Since the return type is void, I wonder if we should even have a CHECK() (not dcheck) for this, to see if we need to weed out cases where this could happen (since it\u0027s for sure not handled).",
