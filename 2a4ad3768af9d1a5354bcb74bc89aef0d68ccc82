      "message": "This is a bit confusing since we\u0027re trying to support two paradigms at once, one where the offer includes both packetization modes and the answer selects one (or both) of them, and one where the offer just includes raw packetization and the answer can either be default or raw. I wonder if we can get rid of this once all the clients are updated.",
