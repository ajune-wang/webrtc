      "message": "This works as a hitless move because port.h includes candidate.h - but leads to IWYU violations in the places where it\u0027s used.\n\nI\u0027m not quite comfortable with moving these to api/ - but I guess it\u0027s transitory due to planning to delete them once we do enums. Note: we need the names still for generating the a\u003dcandidate lines in sdp - but they should become an internal dependency for the SDP-generation code, not something visible in api/\n\nShould we encourage people to use the candidate.is_xxx() function and try to keep the actual enum hidden, or is that too much hiding?\n\n+1 anyway.",

      "message": "Yes,temporary and I think that the type enums will need to sit with the Candidate class anyway rather than Port, so moving the current constants makes follow-up refactoring easier - as does using the is_xxx() functions, which I\u0027m going to do now to start reducing usage of the string constants (for non SDP purposes).",
