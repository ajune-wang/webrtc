      "message": "Good question. It seems safer to fail graciously and log an error.\n\nIf there was a DCHECK instead, it would signal that \"this is a programming error and should not happen\", and it would not be as clear (to us, the maintainers changing this code) that APM is expected to handle a nullptr transient suppressor.\n\nThis approach of not dchecking also makes it possible (on other build systems) to write a test that APM does not crash if transient suppression is disabled from the build but still accidentally enabled from the config.",
