      "message": "I\u0027m introducing this check so that we don\u0027t clear pending packets every single time a description is set, possibly resulting in unnecessarily dropped packets.\n\nThough this check would have been desirable even before this change. RegisterRtpDemuxerSink removes any SSRC-\u003esink mappings, meaning that when using MID-based demuxing, you would have to wait for another packet with a MID extension or in order to relearn the mapping. Which would cause dropped packets every time a description is set, unless the MID extension is used on every single packet.",
