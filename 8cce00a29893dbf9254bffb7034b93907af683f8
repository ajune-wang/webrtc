      "message": "I think there\u0027s a bit of a mismatch here. The signal from JsepTransportController doesn\u0027t specify which MediaTransportState changed, but afaik there can only be one. So then GetMediaTransport probably shouldn\u0027t require a MID value. But if that\u0027s infeasible then maybe the signal should specify the MID.",

      "message": "The integration for media transport is perhaps best described as \"hasty\".  I think we\u0027ve tried to stick to the same model as other transports as much as possible, but also made some simplifying assumptions.  There\u0027s a MID because that\u0027s how JsepTransportController organizes things, but JsepTransportController also requires max bundling for media transports (and I think has DCHECKs and other mechanisms to ensure that there\u0027s only ever one media transport).\n\nSo there\u0027s both a MID required and there\u0027s only ever one.",
