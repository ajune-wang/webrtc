      "message": "Since an RTCP PLI message carries only a single ssrc(?), it makes sense to me to stay close to that in this interface and not implement additional features.\n\nHowever, this has the drawback that if we want to send PLI for several ssrcs at the same time, we\u0027ll now emit one RTCP-over-UDP packet (possibly a full \"compound packet\") for each. I\u0027m not sure if that is a problem? If we need to do something about that, I think the right interface is to have methods like AddPictureLossIndication, AddNack, ..., which builds up a packet without sending it on the wire, and some Send/Flush method which emits a packet including all added messages.",

      "message": "Do not think it is a problem (at least that how it works now: plis for different ssrcs are sent by different RtpRtcp instances in separate packets)\n\nmerging several ssrcs or several fast feedback of different types might be helpful, but that is a bigger topic I consider to address later.\ne.g. with regular sending TransportFeedback for send side bwe it might be better to attach everything to it.",
