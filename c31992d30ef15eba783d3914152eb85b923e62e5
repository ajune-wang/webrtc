      "message": "Hi Ilya and Erik, if we assume a zoo of VP8 encoders we can either SetAtTargetQuality in each and every one of them (but they\u0027d need access to a place in WebRTC which exposes the info), or we can do it in the VSE if we can just store the quality threshold constant in a place where libvpx_vp8_encoder and the VSE can access it. What is your preference, and where would that central location be in your opinion?",
