      "message": "PTAL. There are a few remaining issues.\n\n1. Two tests that want to use 4 temporal layers, which doesn\u0027t work because we have no such scalability mode defined. Currently marked those tests as disabled.\n\n2. Some pieces of code with #if 0 around, where I\u0027m not sure if it can just be deleted, or should be replaced in some way.\n\n3.The changes to use designated initializers could perhaps be taken out to a separate cl, to make this one a bit smaller.\n\n4. There are some downstream tests that need updating before this can be landed.",
