Do you know if Gerrit could be forced to show the changed diff somehow (i.e., disregarding the move)? Or otherwise, maybe we can do the move first, and then the changes?",

      "message": "I agree, it is not easy to review.\n\nGiven that this change touches a relatively new test code which is not widely used yet, we should not be concerned too much about possible issues. It would be enough to come to agreement on conceptual changes (pass codec factories to the tester; make it monolithic). I\u0027m assuming that by LGTMing this you agreed with these high level changes. Is that correct?",
