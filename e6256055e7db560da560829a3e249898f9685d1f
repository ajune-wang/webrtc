      "message": "this feels strange. The worker queue, according to comments that previously were in this file, was meant to replace module_process_thread_. Now the TQ has been moved into a different class, but module_process_thread_ is still here. Further still here, we\u0027re fetching a pointer to a member variable owned by transport_send_ptr_, and giving it to an object that\u0027s not directly aware of the lifetime of the queue or how it\u0027s managed.\n\nIs there a design doc or something that explains these architectural changes? On the surface, it seems like a step backwards to me but I\u0027m probably missing something.",

But it can only change to a non-null value once, so it should be safe to read it out and release the lock (assuming the observer takes responsibility for any additional synchronization it might need internally).",
