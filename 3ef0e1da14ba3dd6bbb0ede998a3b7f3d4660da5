      "message": "This CL fixes this behavior introduced on the new packet buffer and makes it work like the old packet buffer.\n\nIt would be a good idea to add a window in ms to discard old packets and not have to wait until the buffer is full in case a packet is completely lost.",

If a keyframe is found then no frames prior to that can be found.\n\n2) AFAICT this completely breaks the packet buffer. In this situation for example:\n\n    1: keyframe\n    2: \u003cpacket lost\u003e\n    3: keyframe\n\nThe keyframe contained in packet 3 would never be found as we would always return here.",
