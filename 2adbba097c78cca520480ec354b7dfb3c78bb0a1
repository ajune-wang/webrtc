I\u0027m not sure that can really hurt, but needs to be considered.\n",

      "message": "Because this flag is toggled on and off you are not necessarily cancelling in-flight tasks. If SetRtpTransport() is called again and SetAlive() happens, those in-flight tasks would still run.\n\nBecause of this, I think this flag behaves more like a plain old boolean, so I would prefer to see a boolean that is RTC_GUARDED_BY(network_thread()).\n\nAlternatively if the intent was to cancel in-flight tasks, a scoped safety flag can still be used, but then we need to set network_alive_ to a new instance of the safety flag object.",

I.e. you have a criteria update for the old transport, and then you change to a new transport. Is it OK for the old criteria update gets executed on the new transport?",
