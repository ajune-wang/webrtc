      "message": "Do we really need to make a distinction between simulcast and spatial layers here? Does it affect frame id assignment in some way? The idea behind the current design was that simulcast is a kind of spatial layering, and that only the transport needs to configured to do one or the other.\n\nOne difference here is that for spatial layers, we have a single space of buffer ids, but for each simulcast layers we have a separate space (i.e., several layers can refer to \"buffer 3\" and mean different things). But that could be fixed by requiring the simulcast encoder to map into a shared space, with disjoint ranges for each simulcast layer.\n\nMaybe not for this cl, but a different way to resolve that TODO.",
