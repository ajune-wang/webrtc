      "message": "I am not sure it makes sense, given that api/ mostly has the pure virtual versions of things, and the real implementation is largely elsewhere. (I moved the clone test for that reason).\n\nWe should probably have some documentation for \"where to place functions that test api/ functions with a single implementation\" - I think I could be argued into putting them in api/\n\nbut approving this one.",

      "message": "The moved tests exercise the conversion between RTPVideoHeader and VideoFrameMetadata. They are not \"just\" metadata tests, I consider the conversion to be the responsibility of the header because the Get/SetAsMetadata are methods that live on the header. The metadata, not having any other functionality than get/set/defaults, if we wanted to add video_frame_metadata_unittest.cc tests they would test get/set/defaults in isolation (without RTPVideoHeader) imo.",
