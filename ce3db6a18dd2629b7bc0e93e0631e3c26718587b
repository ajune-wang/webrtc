      "message": "I don\u0027t think you need to block handover readiness on this. Even if you would handover the socket while the delayed ack timer is running, it might result in a SACK not being sent after the socket has handed over. SACKs can always get lost, so the peer will just re-send the DATA in case, which would immediately trigger a SACK as it would be receiving a duplicate DATA already received.\n\nRequiring the ack timer to be idle would delay readiness until it fires (~100ms) and becomes idle.",
