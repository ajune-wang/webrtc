      "message": "I have a question. We have \"rtp_stats\" which includes both \"transmitted\" and \"retransmitted\".\nBut then we have \"rtx_stats\" as well. Is \"retransmitted\" ever applicable to RTX?\n\nPer-spec, if the RTX stream is a separate SSRC, this should belong to a separate RTC[In/Out]boundRtpStreamStats object. I wonder if there is follow-up work needed to properly represent RTX streams in stats?\n\nSometimes I think we make invalid assumptions in these layers. Somewhat related but a different issue: for example, if you have simulcast with 3 streams รก 30 fps, this gets reported as 90 fps.",
