      "message": "Two tests are now failing, but from what I can tell it\u0027s actually the tests that don\u0027t behave to spec.\n+titovartem,shampson can I disable these for now, and then we can fix and re-enable them?\n\n* PeerConnectionIntegrationTestUnifiedPlan.EndToEndCallWithTwoVideoTracksAndNoSignaledSsrc\nComment states that:\n// Tests that video flows between multiple video tracks when SSRCs are not\n// signaled. This exercises the MID RTP header extension which is needed to\n// demux the incoming video tracks.\nThe test calls RemoveSsrcsAndKeepMsids() in order to achieve this, but it does not appear that |stream_ids| (i.e. mids) are always empty, so this has in fact been using a single default receive stream which has just been repeatedly created and destroyed for each new ssrc seen. Presumable single-packet frames makes this pass.\n\n* PeerConnectionE2EQualityTestSmokeTest.Simulcast\nThis smoke test sets up a simulcast sender and then expects a single receiver to receive and decode all of the SSRCs. This is in fact not supported and has also been relying on a default stream to decode at least some of the layers.\n",

      "message": "Re: EndToEndCallWithTwoVideoTracksAndNoSignaledSsrc\n\nI don\u0027t see anything wrong with that test as written. It\u0027s checking the basic premise of spec-compliant Unified Plan, i.e. not signaling SSRCs and relying on the MID RTP header extension (note: MID not MSID).\n\nAt the WebRtcVideoEngine level I believe that behavior relied on unsignaled SSRC handling to create the video receive stream. However, there were still some remaining bugs with this implementation, like RTX not working: bugs.webrtc.org/10297",
