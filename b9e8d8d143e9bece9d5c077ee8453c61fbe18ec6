      "message": "Should we call LegacyCreateVideoDecoder here? If so, how to get the stream id? We could add a member in VideoReceiveStream::Decoder. Alternatively, is there any way we could move the stream id to SdpVideoFormat::parameters, instead of using LegacyCreateVideoDecoder? It would be straight forward to let webrtcvideoengine insert the value into that map.",

      "message": "All implementations of the decoder factories except for one known downstream implementation discard the receive_stream_id parameter and just call CreateVideoDecoder, as is the default method.\n\nBut to support this use case, I suppose we should use LegacyCreateVideoDecoder until that implementation can migrate and we can remove that method.\n\nNot sure about putting it in SdpVideoFormat. I think the point of this class is that the parameters are supposed to mirror what is being sent over SDP, so it feels a bit hacky to put it there. Not sure I have any better suggestions though, I don\u0027t know the webrtcvideoengine or video_receive_stream very well.\n\nJust based on the naming of this class and the parameter, does one VideoReceiveStream map to one receive_stream_id? In that case, wouldn\u0027t it make sense that this instance knows about its own id? Sorry if that is a misunderstanding on my part.",
