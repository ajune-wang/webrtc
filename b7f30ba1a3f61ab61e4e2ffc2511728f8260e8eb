      "message": "I am wondering if it would be a better idea to remove the following getters to IceConfig itself? I was originally favor the current version since the implementation of P2PTransportChannel controls the default values. While I am working on the other CL adding sanity checks to validate configuration parameters, I start to feel moving these getters to IceConfig as part of its properties may make more sense. Any ideas?",
