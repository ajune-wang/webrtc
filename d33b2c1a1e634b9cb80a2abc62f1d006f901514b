      "message": "Can you give some more context what \"behave like singlecast\" means?\nHistorically, setting up simulcast and then disabling all but one layer has not been the same as singlecast - as \"true\" singlecast uses the QP scaler and no temporal layers, while the single-active-layer case still uses only bandwidth adaptation and keeps the temporal layering.\n\nIs that still the case here? Is there a difference in how VP8 vs VP9 works?",
