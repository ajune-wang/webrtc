It will be deallocated when nobody wants to create stuff any more.\n\nThe ConnectionResources contains resources that are needed while a call is active. It will be deallocated when the last factory or PeerConnection that depends on it disappears.\n\nThis may change the lifetime of some objects; the last bug was that call_factory needed to survive until the end of the call(s); it\u0027s not just a creator object.",
