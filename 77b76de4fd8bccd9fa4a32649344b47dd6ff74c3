      "message": "That\u0027s quite a lot you\u0027re not formatting. Is it #include ordering that\u0027s the problem? If so, the problem is just going to recur as soon as someone touches the include lines in those files. https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html#disabling-formatting-on-a-piece-of-code will probably help; you could do something like this:\n\n  #include \"my_own_header.h\"\n\n  // Don\u0027t reorder this header; it needs to be first.\n  // clang-format off\n  #include \"pushy_header_that_needs_to_be_first.h\"\n  // clang-format on\n\n  #include \"well_behaved_header.h\"\n  #include \"goody_twoshoes_header.h\"\n\nThen clang-format will hopefully sort the other headers while leaving the protected header alone. (If this doesn\u0027t work, it\u0027s probably time to ask the clang-format people for help.)",
