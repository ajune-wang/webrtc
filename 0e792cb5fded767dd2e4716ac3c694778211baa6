This mean the user of this transform (ie JS via Chrome) has taken a received from from one PC and piped it into a different PC for decoding.\n\nI was using the same approach we added below in https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/301181 of using the frameId as a surrogate frame first/last seq number (as it\u0027s monotonic).\n\nMight try to grab you in person to talk through this all and our options for fixing the TODO we added in that other cl.",
