(I know very little about objc)\n\nI\u0027ve also tried more streightforward approach of propagating through RTCVideoDecoderFactory protocol\nhttps://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/339863\nbut that pulls in c++ specific header, and start to require all users to move from .m to .mm\n\nAlso, this way is similar to how android sdk propagates same parameter.",
