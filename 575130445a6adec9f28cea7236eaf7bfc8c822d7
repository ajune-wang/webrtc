      "message": "Hi, sorry for late reply.\nReading the code,\n1) I can\u0027t find that the tie-breaker is surfaced to sdp/JS,\n2) I though that it might be the same if you have several ice transports (i.e not using BUNDLE), but it seems not to be.\n3) It is only using when receiving/sending ice-pings\n\nSummary: I see no reason why it should exist in anywhere except Port and p2p_transport_channel. I therefor suggest letting p2p_transport_channel\ncreating it \"privately\".\n\nOne thing to double check is that there is no scenario in which the tiebreaker changes during the life-time of p2p_transport_channel. I think not, but I suggest double checking.\n\nHow does that sound ? Am I missing something ?",

      "message": "I think currently the tie breaker is the same for multiple ice transport which share the same jsep transport controller (i.e. from the same peerconnection). But I don\u0027t think it needs to be from a protocol perspective. Reviving an ICE restart is nice but not required either. Now whether we need the tie breaking in WebRTC even...\n\nAgree on the direction but you are thinking two CLs ahead :-)\n\nThe tie breaker is used in two ways currently which makes it confusing. I think they are separate but the tests will tell (hopefully):\n1/ in PortAllocator for creating the foundation. I plan to rename that to \"port allcoator random\" and internalize it.\n2/ in the ICE Transport as the tie breaker value set over the wire. That can indeed be created by the transport itself and not the controller.\n\nThose changes aren\u0027t complicated but will cause a significant amount of churn in the tests.",
