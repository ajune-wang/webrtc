However I don\u0027t read that as being because of this particular branch but rather a coincidence of sorts since it also checks the sdp type.\nThe reason I read it like that is because this is an \"implicit rollback\" branch, which read like a \"by the way\" operation rather than like the other checks that explicitly check for the kRollback sdp type.\nDoes that make sense?",
