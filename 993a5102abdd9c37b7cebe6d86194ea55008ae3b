I\u0027m assuming this is due to some shortcuts it takes with encoding the SquareGenerator video source. The reason I chose 4/3 of this max throughput was based off of the rampup_tests.cc:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/call/rampup_tests.cc?l\u003d406\n\nI updated the comment.

      "message": "I don\u0027t see how the \"4/3\" is applicable here; rampup_tests works by waiting until the BWE ramps up to 3/4 of the network\u0027s capacity, while this test (at least now) doesn\u0027t even have a specific target value it\u0027s waiting for.\n\nIf the encoder only produces a max of ~1Mbps, then we should set the network capacity to something *less* than that (or make the generated video more complex, increasing num_squares or resolution), so we don\u0027t end up \"application limited\". We want to be testing bandwidth estimation, not encoding; we wouldn\u0027t want an improvement in the efficiency of the encoder to show up as a regression in this test.",

      "message": "This value did push the network\u0027s capacity, but you make a good point that we don\u0027t want encoder efficiency improvements to cause alerts. How about half of the max throughput of the encoder (500 Kbps)?  \n\nAs a side note I played around with the network bandwidth values and I found some interesting results. It seems that when the network bandwidth limits the throughput of the encoder, then the bwe \u0026 the encoder throughput actually drop a significant amount. Not sure what the root cause would be, perhaps built up queues? It happens over UDP as well. For example I get the following two results:\n* network bandwidth \u003d 1.5 Mbps\n  BWE \u003d 1426066\n  encoder throughput \u003d 1036616\n* network bandwidth \u003d 1 Mbps\n  BWE \u003d 543417\n  encoder throughput \u003d 553288\n* network bandwidth \u003d 500 Kbps\n  BWE \u003d 276061\n  encoder throughput \u003d 282568\n\nIn the above tests, I would expect the bwe \u0026 throughput to be closer to the actual network bandwidth limit (same with 500 Kbps).\n\nAnyways, I updated the limit to 500 kbps.
