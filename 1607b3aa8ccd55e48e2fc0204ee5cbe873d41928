I realize that with the new check, the formerly-offending code line won\u0027t be reached (the parse will fail before getting that far), but I don\u0027t like removing regression tests.\n\n\nIf you change UDP/DTLS/SCTP to the relevant RTP invocation, the parse should actually succeed, since you changed the parse above to not even try to look for the attributes when you\u0027re doing RTP.",
