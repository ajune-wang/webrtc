      "message": "It looks like if this block is reached due to deactivation, the interrupted state could be set to NO or left as is, with both options being functionally equivalent:\n* if an \"interruption ended notification\" arrives after deactivation, since `activationCount \u003d\u003d 0`, the audio session will not be reactivated;\n* if the audio session is deactivated while `isInterrupted \u003d\u003d YES`, and later the audio session is activated again, `isInterrupted` will be set to NO at that time.\n\nThe choice I think depends on whether we think it\u0027s meaningful for `isInterrupted` to be YES when the audio session has been deactivated. Originally I was thinking that the concept of interruption only applies while the audio session is activated (activationCount \u003e 0). Do you think it should also apply when `activationCount \u003d\u003d 0`?\n\nEither way, your comment made me realize that the argument sent to -notifyDidEndInterruptionWithShouldResumeSession: below should depend on `active`.",
