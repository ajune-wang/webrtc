      "message": "If you wanted more churn, you could consider changing these to take two ArrayView arguments:\n\n  template \u003csize_t N\u003e\n  void ExpectArraysEq(rtc::ArrayView\u003cconst float, N\u003e ref,\n                      rtc::ArrayView\u003cconst float, N\u003e test) {...}\n\nThat way, you could no longer make mistakes with the array sizes.\n\nIt may be better to use EXPECT_THAT with the proper matchers, though. Or to not change it, in the interest of getting this landed. :-)",

      "message": "Replacing this with 20.f makes clang on godbolt.org very happy---by having this constant be a double, you force conversions from float to double and then back again, and you make a double multiplication instead of a float multiplication.\n\n(I see you have double literals elsewhere that ought to be float literals. Maybe give them all f suffixes just to be safe? In fact, I just checked DbToRatio, and it shrinks from 8 to 4 instructions, *and* ends up calling powf() instead of pow(), which I imagine can save quite some time.)",
