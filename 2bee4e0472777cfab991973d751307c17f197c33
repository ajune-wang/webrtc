      "message": "Actually, I have one more idea:\n\nWe can use libportal library, it supports both remote desktop and screencast portals and with that we can drop all the xdg-desktop-portal code and avoid dealing with duplicates. Problem is that it is not ABI stable yet, but that\u0027s something I can work on with the upstream as this has been already requested and I know the people around and already cobtributed there few times. Second problem is that it will not be available everywhere so I guess WebRTC/Chromium has some ways how to proceed in such cases.\n\nlibportal is here: https://github.com/flatpak/libportal\n\nBut this would really simplify things. It would also be future proof, because every portal change will be reflected there and we don\u0027t need to pick the change ourself.",
