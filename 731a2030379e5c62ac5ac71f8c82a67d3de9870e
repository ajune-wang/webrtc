It\u0027s better (because it\u0027s more readable) to use `using` instead:\n\n  using StreamList \u003d std::vector\u003cstd::pair\u003cuint32_t, int\u003e\u003e;\n\n3. It would be much better to replace the std::pair with a struct, so that guessing what the two members mean isn\u0027t so hard. I recognize that such a change doesn\u0027t belong is this CL, though---I assume you\u0027re just duplicating a typedef in a file that you don\u0027t want to #include anymore because it would cause a circular dependency?",
