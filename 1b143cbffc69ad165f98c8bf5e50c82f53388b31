      "message": "To avoid regressions, this utility class needs to be extended to \n\n1. be able to allocate without initialization (how? Replace std::vector with a manually allocated uint8_t*?)\n\n2. grow allocation without destroying old contents. Is there any efficient C++ way to do that, or do we need C realloc?\n\n3. maybe a way to have a small buffer cache, to reduce allocation. Could be something like\n\n  if (HasOneRef() \u0026\u0026 size large enough) { reuse } else { allocate a new buffer }",
