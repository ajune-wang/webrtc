      "message": "What does \"This can be called from the client thread.\" mean? For all implementations (except the proxy), what would be true is \"Must be called from the signaling thread.\" And \"the thread that is used for callbacks\" would also be \"the signaling thread\". Is signaling thread what you mean by \"client thread\"? Should we be consistent and say \"signaling thread\" in both places, or \"client thread\" in both places?",

      "message": "Wouldn\u0027t it be easier to make this a single-threaded class and let chromium worry about which thread it invokes this on? Now you\u0027re making a class that is doing both \"proxy work\" and simple signaling thread-work. In chromium it will still be implicit the fact that thread magic occurs, if we want that we might as well use proxy.",

Do we need to post a task in the destructor that passes it to the right thread before deleting?\n\nThough in-flight tasks are cancelled when the AsyncInvoker is destroyed, so I\u0027m not sure what the best way is to do this in webrtc land.
