      "message": "This is a piggy-backed change. The pre-CL code seems to me like a bug (albeit probably only a theoretical one; see below). If DefaultTemporalLayers has a value in |new_bitrates_bps_|, it will return |true|, then reset |new_bitrates_bps_|. This means only one call to Encode() will see the new value. In practice, this is not a problem, since |new_bitrates_bps_| will only be set by OnRatesUpdated(), and LibvpxVp8Encoder writes to the permanent configuration after calling that. But still, this seems dangerous to me. Is there a reason which I am missing for applying the configuration only temporarily?",

      "message": "This was probably made for screenshare qp-boosting, where in some cases we want to change the maxQP settings for just one frame - so one call to Encode(). Frames after that should revert back to whatever maxQP was used before. That part seems unnecessary now since the default maxQP is remembered and reset within screenshare_layers.\n\nI think settings things permanently like you do is better.",
