      "message": "I agree that that would be a nicer solution, but I think that APM doesn\u0027t actually know if there are receive streams or not. It may be possible to guess it based on how long ago it was since there were calls to ProcessReverseStream(), but that\u0027s a bit hacky. That\u0027s why I put this logic on this level, where we actually have the information of how many receive streams there are. Does that make sense?",
