We do not have consensus yet on the shape of the metric or whether or not it is OK to expose this without restrictions, but I don\u0027t necessarily buy the argument that this is OK just because it is less common.\n\nThe spec meeting this week is cancelled so expect some delays, sorry",

I understand the concern and will wait for the update on the standardization process through the github issue.\nAlso per @Philipp\u0027s feedback, I have already separate the flag out of the general fallback decisions. \nSo I would like to share that, if needed, the current implementation has a flexibility to use this metric only when the decoder starts with hardware decoding to excludes like the VP9 spatial layers fallback.",
