WDYT?\n\n\n",

      "message": "I think it should be \"Wayland\" because it\u0027s what replaces X11 as the next thing on Linux desktop. PipeWire is just a technology/tool we use, together with xdg-desktop-portal, to implement screen sharing. Both are used because Wayland is supposed to be secure and for that reason no app can access any screen content and you have to ask for a permission using xdg-desktop-portal and have the screen content delivered through PipeWire stream.\n\nMaybe the name of the capturer itself is misleading?",
