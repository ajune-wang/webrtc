      "message": "In the case that ```IsVpnMacAddress()``` returns true, It means that the interface is a either Palo Alto Networks Global Protect (PANGP) or Cisco AnyConnect VPN client. Both those drivers report themselves as ```IF_TYPE_ETHERNET_CSMACD``` (0x06) regardless of the actual underlying interface type. So, the current line ```underlying_type_for_vpn \u003d adapter_type;``` is actually equivalent to ```underlying_type_for_vpn \u003d ADAPTER_TYPE_ETHERNET;```, which might be a wrong inference. For that reason I suggest the replacement to ```ADAPTER_TYPE_UNKNOWN``` which reflects reality better.",
