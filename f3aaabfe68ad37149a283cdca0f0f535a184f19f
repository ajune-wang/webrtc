I suspect it wouldn\u0027t, because the \"cell\u003c-\u003ecell\" connections would still be kept alive for 30 seconds by \"DEAD_CONNECTION_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT\": https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/p2p/base/p2pconstants.cc?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d68\n\nMeaning, to really test the scenario that our implementation currently fails at, you\u0027d need to wait at least 30 seconds, and *then* simulate losing Wi-Fi. But I could be wrong.",
