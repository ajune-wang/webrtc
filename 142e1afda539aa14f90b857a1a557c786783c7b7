      "message": "You\u0027re using 0 to imply \"we don\u0027t have an RTT value\" here, but you should be able to get 0 ms ping if you on a very good/close e2e network or on LAN, etc? Or in loopback testing.\n\nYou can instead see if there exists an RTT measurement with block.num_rtts() \u003e 0 so please consider making max_rtt_ms an optional value instead so hat we can invoke OnRttUpdate() even if we have a 0 ms ping.\n\nOr you could fix that in a follow-up CL if you prefer?",

      "message": "Yes, you\u0027re right, rtt can be zero, but I prefer it to be fixed in a separate CL because that kind of improvement is out of scope of this change. Here I prefer to keep old behaviour.\n\nI do not promise I\u0027ll do such follow-up, in particular because RtpRtcpImpl is not used by chromium (it is deprecated in favor of RtpRtcpImpl2).\nIt is also likely all this block is not needed at all. at least there was a reason not to migrate it into RtpRtcpImpl2",
