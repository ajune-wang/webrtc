      "message": "Thanks. A 2.6% power reduction seems well worth it.\n\nThe locks and atomics introduce some additional complexity though. For example,\nthere seems to be a bit of a race that might cause events to be dropped: Let\u0027s say that a new event is logged and and logging is not in progress according to the atomic check on line 143. Before the event can be written to memory, logging is started on another thread, which dumps the contents of the memory buffer to a file.\nThen the first event is added to the (now empty) memory buffer.\n\nThis could be fixed by taking the lock earlier, I think. However, I understand that Markus has a different proposal to solve the same problem. I suggest we wait a bit and compare the two approaches.",
