There\u0027s one problem with AudioFrameView however which is that it\u0027s both const and non const, which means that it\u0027s not a fit for either AudioFrame::data() or AudioFrame::mutable_data() (arguably it would fit for the latter, but there we don\u0027t really need/want the \u0027const\u0027 part).\n\nThoughts?",
