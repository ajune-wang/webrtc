      "message": "To use this Picker in Chrome Remote Desktop, we will need to report the real `SourceId` that is being captured.\n\nIf you need it to be constant, you could maybe clear the `allowsChangingSelectedContent` flag on the `SCContentSharingPickerConfiguration`?\n\nOtherwise, you could maybe call `OnSelection()` on the `DelegatedSourceListController` every time the `SourceId` changes - and then the consumer can get the new ID by calling `GetSourceList()`?\n\nThe selected screen ID is not documented in the SCK API, but Apple told us we can get it from the `display` attribute of the `SCContentFilter` property that\u0027s with the `SCContentSharingPicker`.\n\nI think this CL is fine for now, but we will eventually need to access the actual `SourceId` for Chrome Remote Desktop.\n\nFor now, I\u0027m not too concerned about the value of `allowsChangingSelectedContent`. We could always add a `DesktopCaptureOptions` setting for this later, if we need to change it?",
