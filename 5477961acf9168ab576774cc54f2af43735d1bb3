      "message": "Sigh.  The X11 code has a CFI violation at x_server_pixel_buffer.cc:156.  This means Chromium\u0027s control flow integrity checker believes that a function pointer is not used correctly.  I looked at the code and couldn\u0027t tell exactly what the problem was, so it could be a false positive.\n\nChromium has an exception to allow this code to be used but the exception needs to be updated since you are moving the file location.\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:tools/cfi/ignores.txt;drc\u003d8d1463d7693bbf0cc3f8933eb0462165aca8ea75;l\u003d189\n\nSo try the following:\n\n1. Add an exception for the new file location (or change to use a wildcard)\n2. Reland this patch\n3. Remove the exception for the old file location (if needed)",
