      "message": "Thanks Sergey, this tool is more easy to use for the comparison for different codec between HW/SW encoder. I hope that this tool will be more comprehensive and easy to use in the future. In fact, there are more features that Chromium\u0027s HW video encoder tool has, but this SW encoder tool does not support them yet.",
