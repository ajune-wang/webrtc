      "message": "Probably all good. But I can\u0027t CR+1 in this project. So I say LGTM!\n\nAlso deferring to folks that commented on the bug you refer to. According to docu it looks right to me ~ some nit picking.\n\nThe last one depends on if it indeed meant all .lua files in the project or some specific .lua files in the main dir. For gn I believe it means all. Guess the same for lua.\n\nCan the BUILD.gn rule not be reduced to one rule saying ...BUILD.gn? Or are you afraid it matches my/path/FOO-BUILD.gn?\n\nFrom the docu it\u0027s not clear to me if 4 dots always resolve the 3 dots first? Eg. can ....gni match `.my/cool/yagni` ?",
