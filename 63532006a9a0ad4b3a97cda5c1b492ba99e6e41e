      "message": "From the test failures I\u0027m realizing that the thread assertions aren\u0027t going to work, because users of the API are expected to construct the SessionDescription on their own thread and then pass it into WebRTC\u0027s signaling thread (transferring ownership).\n\nSo I need to either get rid of the assertions, or add a method to change the thread the SessionDescription is attached to. I don\u0027t like that idea because it would clutter SessionDescriptionInterface... Let me know if you have any opinions.",

      "message": "Is making this public acceptable? Since we\u0027re saying \"you must do stuff with SessionDescriptions on this thread\", it only seems fair to expose it.\n\nWithout doing this, getting the thread pointer to the JNI code was a pain. There are two ways to construct a Java PeerConnection, both of which would require passing the thread handle through them somehow. And these constructors are called directly from downstream code that would need updating.",
