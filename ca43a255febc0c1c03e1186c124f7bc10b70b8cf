      "message": "Is the problem that you\u0027re planning to use a pool of size 1 for all task queues in the system, and we have code that makes blocking calls from one task queue to another? And you plan to work around the problem by letting the single, \"blocked\" thread do other work for the pool while it waits?\n\nAn alternative that\u0027s simpler for the TQ implementations would be to have TQBase methods called e.g. StartBlockingOperation() and EndBlockingOperation() that you call around the Wait(). Defaulting to no-ops, but implementations could e.g. use them to temporarily increase their pool size by 1.",
