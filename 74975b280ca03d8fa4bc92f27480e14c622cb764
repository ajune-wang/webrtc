Please check and merge into yours if it makes sense.\n\n// The values have been found as follows. Given the initial pitch period T, we\n// examine whether one of its harmonics is the true fundamental frequency. We consider\n// T/k with k in {2, ..., 15}. For each of these harmonics, in addition to the pitch gain of\n// itself, we choose one multiple of its pitch period, n*T/k, to validate it (by averaging their // pitch gains). The multiplier n is chosen so that n*T/k is used only one time over all k.\n// The array can be generate in Python as follows:",
