Please document the member variables. This is especially important for the latter two, whose type doesn\u0027t provide any significant implicit documentation.",

For example, it\u0027s often the case that pointer members can be const even if they point to non-const things.\n\n`const` is a great help when reading code, and the longer the lifetime of the variable (measured in lines of code), the more helpful it is.)",
