      "message": "I choose not to store `env` for now because that is currently not needed.\nEarlier I thought I need to store `env` to query \u0027Audio-OpusAvoidNoisePumpingDuringDtx\u0027 field trial, but choose to cleanup that field trial instead.\n\nHowever there are two possible followups, each would require to store env_:\n\nOne is to switch from using rtc::TimeMillis() to injected env.clock()\nAnother one is to simplify signature of the \u0027EnableAudioNetworkAdaptor\u0027 - remove RtcEventLog parameter and instead use the one that is passed as env.event_log()\n\nHowever both of these improvements are out of scope of my current effort (reduce usage of the global field trial string), i.e., I do not plan to do such improvements myself any time soon.",
