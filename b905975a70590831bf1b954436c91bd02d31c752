      "message": "I\u0027d prefer at least for audio_decoder_proxy_factory.h to go in test-only target. function_audio_decoder_factory.h on the other hand makes some sense to use in production utilities.\n\nIs it important to change analyzer back to non-test, or is it enough to cut the dependency on gmock/gtest? In the latter case, the new target could be marked test-only, and still solve the problem.\n\nAnother alternative is to let analyzer.cc define its own AudioDecoderFactory class, without using the FunctionAudioDecoderFactory convenience class (but even if we do that, I think the split in this cl is right; using one of the convenience factory classes shouldn\u0027t imply a dependency on gmock or gtest).",
