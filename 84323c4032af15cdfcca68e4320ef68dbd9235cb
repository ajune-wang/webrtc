      "message": "What\u0027s the benefit of getting this information via PeerConnectionSdpMethods as opposed to having call_ptr, media_config, etc part of the CreateChannel() method arguments? So far the interface does not justify itself, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more to come.\n\nIf there will be a lot more interaction between RtpTransceiver and pc_ to come in follow-up CLs that RtpTransceiver will need to know about the most things pc going forward, then should we make pc_ be a member variable instead of an argument?",

      "message": "Mainly a disgust at having to add 4 more arguments to an already overlong argument list. I think the channel manager interface is wrongly designed - SRTP and crypto options are transport things, not media things, and Call is constant over a PC\u0027s lifetime, so it should be passed to the channel manager constructor instead of being passed here.\n\nBut that\u0027s for a different CL.\n\nDo you think I should pass the 4 arguments separately? It would take away the dependency of rtp_transceiver on peer_connection_sdp_methods, which may be a Good Thing.",
