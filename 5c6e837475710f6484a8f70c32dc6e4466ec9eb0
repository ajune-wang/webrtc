      "message": "This can happen if unittest tries to create two peerconnections using `BasicNetworkManager`, exchange candidates, and then call GetStats.\n\nIn this case the candidate may have a network type other than `ADAPTER_TYPE_UNKNOWN`, but this code is not taking that into account.\n\nMost tests use `FakeNetworkManager` and by default `FakeNetworkManager.AddInterface` will add an fake network adapter with `ADAPTER_TYPE_UNKNOWN`, so it will not trigger this issue.\n\n\nInstead of deleting the whole else block, I\u0027m going to add a comment like below.\n```\n// network_type, relay_protocol, url, network_adapter_type are not defined\n// in the remote candidate.\n```",
