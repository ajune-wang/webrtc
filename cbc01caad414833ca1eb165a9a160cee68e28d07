      "message": "Unfortunately it\u0027s not easily possible to do this in the constructor. The reason is related to how flags are parsed in the neteq_rtpplay utility. \n\nIn neteq_rtpplay we want to be able to set field-trials in a command-line flag. However, the command-line flags are parsed in the CreateSimulator function, so at construction time, flags are not available yet. This means that for neteq_rtpplay we should first call CreateSimulator, and then call SetFieldTrials afterwards. I realize this is a bit clunky, but I\u0027m not sure how to make it better. Let me know if you have a good suggestion.",
