But it turned out to be a bit more complicated than I initially expected.\n\n\u003e I think that long-term, there is a desire to have webrtc::AudioProcessing not be refcounted, to make ownership clearer.\n\nSounds reasonable to me, but I\u0027m not that familiar with this code. What are the main owners of the APM object? There\u0027s some interfaces for injecting it from the application? Will switching to unique_ptr be a complicated api change?\n\n\u003e Complicated Chrome code has blocked, but I am not sure that it is still the case. \n\nFor what it\u0027s worth, no breakage detected by the chromium compile bots (but on the other hand, most other breakage I had to fix didn\u0027t happen until runtime). What\u0027s the easiest way to run relevant chromium tests with this cl applied?\n \n\u003e This CL makes the current code uniform and less confusing, but can be argued to push the long-term goal further away.\n\nNot sure about this particular case, but in general, reducing confusion tends to make later refactoring easier.",

      "message": "I fully agree about the aspects of avoiding refcounting where it is not needed.\n\nHowever, the way it has been avoided in Chromium is risky in the sense that if any code therein would treat the AudioProcessing object as a scoped_refptr (which it actually is) it would unintentionally automatically be deleted.\n\nTreating the AudioProcessing object using a raw-pointer instead of as a scoped_refptr is IMO also risky in that it only works due to details for how scoped_refptr is implemented.\n\nTherefore I think a good step is to properly handle it as a scoped_refptr and adjust the code in Chromium to treat the AudioProcessing object as what it is.\n\nAn aspect for the Chromium code using this object is that even though its ownership is fairly clear, the way the raw pointer is shared in that code makes leveraging that ownership tricky. One such example is that it is very difficult to re-create APM during an ongoing call.",
