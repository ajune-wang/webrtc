      "message": "It should be better to depend on :rtc_base_approved (it exposes rtc_base/event.h through public_deps on :rtc_base_approved_generic) which will compile logging_mac.mm if the target platform is mac and we are not building inside chromium.\n\nBut I am trying to reunify the :rtc_base_approved target to remove usage of public_deps so I think it is safe to leave it here since weak_ptr_unittest.cc doesn\u0027t use logging. I will change it during the refactoring.",
