      "message": "Some related suggestions: Private methods could be annotated with RTC_RUN_ON, replacing run time checks RTC_DCHECK_RUN_ON with a compile time check.\n\nIf SdpOfferAnswerer is single threaded (nothing ever called on any other thread but the signal thread), it might make sense to remove explicit references to signaling_thread and add a thread checker instead.\n\nWhere the class instance is declared, in peer_connection.h, I think the unique_ptr should be annotated RTC_PT_GUARDED_BY, since also contents of the object should be accessed only on the signaling thread.\n",
