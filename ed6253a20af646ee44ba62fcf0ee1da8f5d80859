      "message": "Note that rtc::Bind has special logic to capture ref-counted `this` with an rtc::scoped_refptr.\n\nMost other changes in this CL it doesn\u0027t matter since the callback is used in an Invoke where we don\u0027t have to worry about the object getting deleted out from underneath. But in this case the task is being posted asynchronously so you\u0027ll want to capture this as a scoped_refptr. Same for the other PostTasks in this file.",
