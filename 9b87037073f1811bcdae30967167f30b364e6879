All you seem to need for that is some way for WebRTC to maintain a process-global XdgDesktopPortal instance to route the calls through, though you could, if you prefer, require that callers maintain that, if WebRTC maintainers prefer that?",

DesktopCaptureOptions is scoped to a single capture operation, and specifies the options for that operation - you should think of it as a structure of arguments.\n\nThis change seems to actually want to retain a single _process-global_ instance of the XdgDesktopPortalBase, and to associate a request-Id with each DesktopCaptureOptions instance, I think?\n\nThat can be implemented much more simply with a process-global holding the XdgDesktopPortal, and then having an atomic-integer used to uniquely identify each DesktopCaptureOptions, i.e. to unique identify each request.",
