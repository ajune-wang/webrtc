(Human nature being what it is I can\u0027t promise that you won\u0027t, but try not to feel it.) OWNERS is supposed to be a list of people well suited to review CLs touching a specific subtree, and filling it with people who don\u0027t actually know the subtree all that well isn\u0027t doing anyone any favors.\n\nIn the absence of a better idea, err on the side of parsimony and populate the list with just the people who will be actively working to migrate stuff to the new directory. Additional owners can easily be added later, as you identify specific individuals that really ought to be in the list.",
