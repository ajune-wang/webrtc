      "message": "Is this really caused by \"cannot read test files\". or is that the logic is different on mobile devices? As far as I can see from the failing tests (I have not investigate them deeply), it reads\n\n[02:22:40:INFO] ../../modules/audio_coding/test/TestVADDTX.cc:169: Failure\n[02:22:40:INFO] Expected equality of these values:\n[02:22:40:INFO]   0u\n[02:22:40:INFO]     Which is: 0\n[02:22:40:INFO]   st\n[02:22:40:INFO]     Which is: 11\n[02:22:40:INFO] stats[2] error.\n\nIf the difference in the outcome of mobile devices is expected, we can define the \"expects\" for android and iOS rather than disabling the tests? WDYT?",
