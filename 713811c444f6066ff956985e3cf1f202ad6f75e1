      "message": "Yes, I tested and saw great improvement. With the self built Chromium webrtc-internals crashes after few seconds, so getting the after plot is problematic, but I can log the stats to console. Improving for DTX scenario seemed more complex, but I can look into it more.",

      "message": "I built Chromimum with official build flags now and looks like the crashes went away. So I should be able to provide the stats plots. When I tried to also change delay during DTX, it happens that silent concealed sample count gets bigger than just concealed sample count, which makes some debug checks to fail. Need to dig more.",

      "message": "I agree. I haven\u0027t done much listening tests. The scenario which I am particularly interested to improve is synchronising multiple jitter buffers. For example if there are several playbacks in the same room and these are little bit off then AEC fails to cancel that playback out and remotes hear echo. In which case it is more important to maintain good sync and adapt to a target quickly even if it may cause slight degradation to audio.",
