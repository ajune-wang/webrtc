      "message": "nit: This number comes from the packets constructed from CreateRtpPacket with kPacketSize1 \u003d 100, and it using a hardcoded 12 as the header size. These numbers would seem less magical if you explicitly set packet1_ and packet2_ to CreateRtpPacket(ssrc,header_size,payload_size,padding_size), or if you added a comment to say that packet1_ and packet2_ has such and such payload size\n\nUp to you, either way, LGTM",
