      "message": "Hm. If I read it right, this will cease transmission when cwnd is 0.9*MTU.\n\nIf we are sending a stream of small packets (mouse movements), this will choke off the packet flow earlier than without this restriction.\n\nShould there be a second condition that says \"if the next packet fits in the cwnd and contains an end-of-message, send it anyway\"?\n",

      "message": "That\u0027s a good point you\u0027re making. \n\nThis optimization is generally applicable to sending large messages (which without it, results in many more fragments, many very small in size), but for small messages - as you say - it\u0027s not optimal.\n\nI\u0027ll reiterate it a bit to cover that situation as well - thanks!",
