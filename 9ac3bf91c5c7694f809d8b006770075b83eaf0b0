It doesn\u0027t tell you what resources it is acquiring, which is the important part of this class.\n\nFrom reading the code, it seems that it only initializes (on init) and clears (on destruction) the TestKeys variable, which allows keys to be registered that won\u0027t throw on use of nonregistered field trial names.",
