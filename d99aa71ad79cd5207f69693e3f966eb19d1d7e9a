      "message": "Hi Per,\n\nI moved the work in https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/234754 in a new CL since the one you initially reviewed became bigger and I had to split it.\n\nI already addressed your comments from the other CL, namely:\n- GainController2 ctor requires sample rate and number of channels so that there\u0027s no need to call Initialize() after creation\n- added a flag indicating if the config has changed when AudioProcessingImpl::InitializeGainController2() is called\n\nCheers,\nAlessio",

If this is expected to be called often, in particular during runtime, I\u0027d advice revisiting the need of having this value in dB.\n\ndB is a nice to have, but if there is a performance cost I think it makes sense to keep using the linear value.",
