      "message": "[Question] Which potential issue?\n\nAm I correct by saying that:\n* We want to group by frames by their timestamp, since there can be several resolutions (multicast) and we only want to keep the maximum one.\n* We have to store the frames for consolidation since:\n   * We cannot rely on simulcast index to get the highest resolution (e.g. highest always on first index).\n   * We cannot rely on the number of frames for a given timestamp (either because we don\u0027t know the max index or because we may miss frames).",
