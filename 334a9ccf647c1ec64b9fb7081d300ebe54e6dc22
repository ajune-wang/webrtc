      "message": "Hm. If you use Port rather than PortInterface here, I think you can remove the declarations of SubscribePortDestroyed and SendPortDestroyed from the PortInterface class, leaving them as implementation details of Port. I think everyone who knows about the signal already knows they are dealing with a Port, and don\u0027t need this API to be visible on the abstraction.",
