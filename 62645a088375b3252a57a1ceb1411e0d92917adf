      "message": "You can use single console to view both buildbot and LUCI builds and have Milo merge them in smart way: it will always display a build that is not experimental, so when you flip the toggle in the migration app, the list of builds will contain mix of buildbot/luci builds. See for example how we do it in V8: https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/5d38ea037b3cb3070d42cd1ef68f9d297f15afad/luci-milo.cfg#90",

      "message": "Hi Sergiy,\nThanks for the comment. I\u0027m mostly aware of what V8 is doing, because I was modelling this after your milo config. I didn\u0027t fully understand what having 2 builders in the same place means, so thanks for the explanation.\n\nHowever, I think the approach of flipping one builder at a time may be more confusing, especially for non-infra devs. Perhaps we will be able to pull off a swifter migration strategy (flip everything around the same time).\nBut I may still rethink this and take your suggested approach.\n\nAlso a nice bonus of the approach I took is that by switching between two tabs I get a comparison view for free.\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/p/webrtc/g/client.webrtc/console\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/p/webrtc/g/ci/console (seems broken at the moment but whatever)",

      "message": "For comparison purposes we use a separate comparison console, but it requires adding builders there manually: https://ci.chromium.org/p/v8/g/side-by-side/console, therefore there is a clear advantage to your comparison approach. Perhaps I\u0027ll add a similar LUCI-only view for us.\n\nAs for flipping one builder at a time - this worked fine for V8 tryserver: LUCI builds should mostly look like Buildbot builds and developers don\u0027t really notice. However, should someone need to check a historic build from the console, developers would need need to know when the migration actually happened and which console they need to use to look up an actual non-experimental build. This becomes especially important if you flip a builder back and force several times (e.g. when testing a builder with significant side effects that can not be tested in experimental mode).\n\nMigrating all at once is nice, but may break a lot of things at the same time increasing overall downtime for developers. We chose iterative approach, but it may not be necessary for your infra.",
