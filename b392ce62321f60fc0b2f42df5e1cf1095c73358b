This is a roll forward of a previously reviewed CL that caused compilation error for `cast_shell_linux` check in chrome. Summary of changes from the previously submitted and reverted CL can be found here: https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/257000/1..27/. Please let me know if any other checks will be good to run before submitting this CL so as to not affect any builds.",
