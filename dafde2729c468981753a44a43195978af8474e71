      "message": "1) Definitely possible. I made the smallest change necessary, but definitely possible with a bigger change to resolve from a string_view and family, if there is a strong opinion for it. In fact that\u0027s the signature of the wrapper over the syscall.\n\n2) I think setting the family on an unresolved SocketAddress feels a bit backwards - the family should be the result of the resolution. But more practically, I didn\u0027t go this route because it would entail messing with a bunch of const-ness in (*)port.cc which didn\u0027t seem reasonable.",
