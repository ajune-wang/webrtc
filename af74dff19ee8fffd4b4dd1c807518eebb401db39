      "message": "This change broke behavior of iOS and Android SDK. With this change recording via `AudioDeviceModule` is started as soon as peer connection is connected. It even started when there is no active outgoing audio track in rtp sender.\nE.g:\n```swift\nlet microphoneAndCameraStreamName \u003d UUID().uuidString\nlet microphoneTransceiverInit \u003d RTCRtpTransceiverInit().then { obj in\n  obj.direction \u003d .sendOnly\n  obj.streamIds \u003d [microphoneAndCameraStreamName]\n  obj.sendEncodings \u003d [\n    RTCRtpEncodingParameters().then { params in\n      params.adaptiveAudioPacketTime \u003d true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n// Previously presence of audio transceiver without audio track didn\u0027t cause audio being captured and sent.\n// Sending was controlled by adding/removing audio track to transceiver. \n// But with this change audio capture started and audio is actually sent without audio track at all. \nlet outgoingMicrophoneTransceiver \u003d peerConnection.addTransceiver(of: .audio, init: microphoneTransceiverInit)!\n```\nPalak@, Harald@ could you please confirm that this is was not intentional behavior change and it could be fixed/re-considred?",
