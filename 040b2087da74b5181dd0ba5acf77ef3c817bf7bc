      "message": "While English is not my first language I maintain that \"append\" is misleading here, and this confused my for a good while yesterday (it suggests that function builds a list of stats for different endpoints). This function maybe \"aggregates\", \"accumulates\", or \"combines\" stats reports across different endpoints.\n\n\"aggregate: add (something) to the end of a written document.\"\n\"aggregate: a whole formed by combining several separate elements.\"\n\n(with exception: LocalAddresses is actually appended but I think that is a bug).",

E.g. in an A, B, C scenario:\ncall for A adds B,C\ncall for B adds A,C\ncall for C adds A,B\nso now vector contains all local endpoints twice? Or? If correct, fine to fix in a follow up.",

      "message": "I also maintain that this needs a comment. The code as such is an easy read, but what it achieves is very hard to deduce - I had to go to the function invocation to find out. So please add comments to make it clear. \n\nOr even better: this function is used in exactly one place, in network_emulation_manager.cc, where it is called in a loop. Why not add a function AggregateStatsAcrossAllEndpoints(ArrayView ...) that does the loop calling the (made private) function at hand?",
