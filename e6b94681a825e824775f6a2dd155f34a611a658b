While on the interface level, SetReceiveAudioSink guarantees that no further processing will occur, one might already be in progress.\n\n\nAnd on the other note: in the real downstream implemenetation today, we are invoking this method under the lock (so that SetReceiveAudioSink(nullptr) blocks until OnData()  finishes).\n\nis audio_coding-\u003eIncomingPacket asynchronous?",
