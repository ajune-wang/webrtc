      "message": "I think we still want to address a few more things in the cxx17 file:\n- Many symbols are defined in multiple locations in the canonical STL I used ( https://github.com/PeterFeicht/cppreference-doc ). Could be fixed upstream, we could remove duplicate definitions if we agree on the canonical header to be used most of the time.\n- Some symbols like std::swap are used in too many places, should we remove them?",
