To add to the discussion in the other thread I started thinking about the non-obvious parts of the TQ contract that we might have missed and then realized that because there weren\u0027t tests, we missed things like supporting TaskQueue::Current() from within the callback etc. So there are subtle things that I\u0027d like to think through first at the TQ level.",
