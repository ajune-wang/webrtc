      "message": "Thanks for fixing this Jeremy.  I think the point of the previous patch (which resolved a /0 problem) is that a 0 target rate is not a legitimate input and thus should be blocked as a potential source of exploits or crashes, just as encoding a 0x0 sized image would not make sense. I will leave your own team to +2 this but it is fine from my perspective.",
