WebRtcVoiceMediaChannel is a subclass of cricket::MediaChannel, which is 1:1 mapped to an RtpTransceiver.\n\nWith the death of Plan B, having mulitple streams in a VoiceMediaChannel should be impossible - but there\u0027s lots of legacy code that assumes we can have more than one still.\n\nI\u0027ll make a quick hack to see if we ever have more than one; if there is only one, getting the right transformer should be a no-brainer - there is only one.",

And I couldn\u0027t identify any tests that I\u0027d associate with this bug in the video pipeline either. Perhaps I\u0027ve missed them.\n\nIn any case, if tests are required, I\u0027ll need guidance to what exactly should be tested and where.",
