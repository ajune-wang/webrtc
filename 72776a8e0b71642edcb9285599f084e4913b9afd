      "message": "I gather this is for the case where you have an implementation that takes two arguments but the second one has a default value? Without this, CallMakeAudioDecoder would get two identical overloads. If we don\u0027t consider that option, I think the overload could be made simpler and without this class.",

      "message": "Yes, this class is necessary iff the MakeAudioDecoder overload set accepts both one and two arguments. So we could do without it by imposing that extra restriction.\n\nI would argue that that\u0027s not worth doing, however, since I already have a CL lined up that removes support for the one-argument form of MakeAudioDecoder, including nuking this helper class.",
