      "message": "Overall looks good, but we\u0027re using this value only to set how long we wait before PLI now - and not actually setting the packet history size.\n\nAlso, maybe I missed it, but would be good with some input validation and capping the value within reasonable bounds. I believe the packet history already has a cap of 9600 packets, but I\u0027d rather no rely on validation all the way at the bottom of the stack.\n\n+philipel has more context on the pli timeouts, care to comment?\n",
