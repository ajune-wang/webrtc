Please document the member variables. This is especially important for the latter two, whose type doesn\u0027t provide any significant implicit documentation.",

A struct with only const members would be approximately the same thing - is that even allowed?\nI\u0027m eager to not start new patterns if not required.\n\n2. I\u0027ll link to the spec - these exactly reflect spec attributes, so that should be good enough.",
