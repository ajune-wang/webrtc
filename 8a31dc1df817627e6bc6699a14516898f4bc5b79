      "message": "Yes, I agree it is too powerful of a tool. On the other hand, as Artem has written I am not sure there is another way to achieve this (if we want the framework to be in control of these actions). The framework basically executes actions on behalf of the test writer. Artem, do we you have other examples of \"environment changing\" actions?",

Currently we have only one, right?\n\nIf someone re-implements the network, they also would have to implement a scenario behavior there.\n\nWhy can\u0027t you add this to SimulatedNetwork? It already has SecConfig, add a SetConfigAfter(.., delay_ms). Then you don\u0027t even need any task queue, just update the config each time in |SimulatedNetwork::GetConfigState|.
