      "message": "LGTM,\n\nOne more question for Mirko though: In the spirit of reducing number of build flags, could anything be done about the `WEBRTC_ENABLE_PROTOBUF` defines? Could the buildtarget be conditionally defined based on `rtc_enable_protobuf` instead, or will that not make a meaningful difference in removing this build flag?",

      "message": "I think it is possible to workaround WEBRTC_ENABLE_PROTOBUF but we still need rtc_enable_protobuf and it is possible that without the macro we will have to structure the code differently, for example include in the build files referring to protos only when rtc_enable_protobuf\u003dtrue, for tests, this sounds easy, we should try of non test code, there we might get into some troubles but with enough refactoring this should be doable.",
