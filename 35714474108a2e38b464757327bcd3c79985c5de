Unfortunately it seems we just have to document it\u0027s supposedly used in isolation, or do you (@deadbeef, @nisse) have some other recommendation?",

Main use seems to be from Thread::Run via Thread::ProcessMessages (a public method!), but other callers could be a problem. When you tried adding a thread checker (or it seems it should be SequenceChecker now), did you call Detach() from the constructor?\n\nDocumenting usage for now is good enough for me.",
