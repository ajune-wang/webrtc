      "message": "So there\u0027s always a role when \"transport\" stats exist, with dtlsRole being \"client\". But after the handshake it could permanently change to \"server\". And \"unknown\" is never a thing?\n\nHarald: What makes more sense?\n- Removing \"unknown\" in favor of \"client\"/\"server\" even though \"client\" could change to \"server\" in the initial handshake.\n- Or reporting \"unknown\" until the initial handshake has completed.",
