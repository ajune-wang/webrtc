      "message": "On some layers of our code base DISABLED is the default value but according to spec DISABLED does not exist and there are some TODOs to remove it, so I prefer to use some other DegradationPreference value other than DISABLED just in case. Also while it may not have a value by default on this layer, I have a feeling that MAINTAIN_FRAMERATE tends to be the behavior we get if we don\u0027t say anything.\n\nnit: Can you update this test to use MAINTAIN_RESOLUTION instead? It might not matter but that seems the most future-proof in case we delete DISABLED and start defaulting to MAINTAIN_FRAMERATE at some point",
