      "message": "\u003e Do I get this right, that each entry in this vector corresponds to the most recently seen receiver report block(s?) for one outgoing stream?\n\nYes.\n\ndanilchap@ explained to me that these Report Blocks can come in either Sender Reports or Receiver Reports depending on how the call is set up, so adding \"sender\" or \"receiver\" may or may not be misleading. I would ask him, though he already approved the CL that decided on the name ReportBlockData.\n\n\u003e Is there anything similar for sent and/or received sender report blocks? Do they use the same types? If not, maybe ReportBlockData is a too general name.\n\nYes. In the future we will add remote-outbound-rtp stats, but these are also based on Report Blocks. ReportBlockData is a ReportBlock with additional data (such as receive timestamp and RTT measurement). I believe the same type will be used.\n\n---\n\nSo what are |report_block_datas| here in this CL?\n- They are report blocks received about remote inbound RTP, meaning they are feedback information from the other endpoint about streams that we are sending (local outbound RTP).\n\nWould you prefer the name \"remote_inbound_report_block_datas\"? Or \"receiver_report_block_datas\"?",

If a more specific name is needed, it makes sense to use name consistent with the js apis, even though I find \"remote_inbound_...\" a bit unwieldy.\n\nIf the same type ReportBlockData is suitable for receive-stream stats based on received sender report blocks (I\u0027m under the impression that values reported in that case are quite different, but I may be wrong), then ReportBlockData is an ok name.",

      "message": "ReportBlockData should probably be used for both remote inbound and remote outbound RTP. But even if we are only talking about remote inbound RTP (this CL), then they could come from either a Sender Report or a Receiver Report, in both cases these end up at the RTCPReceiver.\n\n\"receiver_report_blocks\" might makes sense in that \"they come from an RTCPReceiver\". But that might be true of remote outbound RTP as well - I don\u0027t know how that will be wired yet.\n\nI think we\u0027ll have a better idea once we wire up remote outbound RTP stats as well. Right now, the ReportBlockData name is not direction-specific on purpose because I think it will be used for both. I could be wrong but that is my current understanding.\n\nIf it ends up only being used in one direction I am happy to rename it but I don\u0027t want to rename the type of a class that right now is meant to be direction-agnostic.\n\nDo you still see the need for me to rename something, if so what?",
