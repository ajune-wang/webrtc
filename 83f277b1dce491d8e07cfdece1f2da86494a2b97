      "message": "Yes I looked around for places in and outside of the webrtc repo, looking for potentially impacted places and in all places I could find, there was no distinction between the worker thread and the network thread. So in Call, network_thread_ is set to point to the same thread as those places expect.\n\nThe difference in this patch is that where WebRTC is used via the public APIs, Call is aware of what thread is the network thread and in DeliverPacketAsync, we DCHECK the correct thread (call will come via the video/voice engine classes).",
