      "message": "Because the writes are protected by the mutex, they cannot race with each other. Reads can\u0027t race with each other. So the only racy part is that a read may occur either before or after another thread writes to holder_ (they cannot be interleaved; even std::memory_order_relaxed guarantees that). But if our thread ID is x, other threads always change holder_ from y to z where y !\u003d x and z !\u003d x, so it makes no difference.\n\nNothing here requires us to prevent accesses to things other than holder_ itself from being reordered past the atomic instructions. Therefore, std::memory_order_relaxed is sufficient.",
