Typically you are not interested in the very end of the RTP dump, you are interesting in how the receiving client behaves over a period of time. Even if we wanted to we couldn\u0027t really wait for the last frame to be decoded since we don\u0027t know what the client decided to do (did it drop the frame?), all we can do is to give the client some more time to see what it would have done.\n\n\u003e I also question the name - should it be --wait_after_last_read_rtp_packet, to show what it is actually doing?\n\nI think `extend_run_time_duration` is clearer, since we are actually continuing to run the receiving client.",
