I prefer behavioral-driven tests to tests that asserts multiple outcomes/behaviors of a single use case.\n\nTests that would be good for the added code:\n- When a single frame is dropped (basically what you\u0027re doing above but in a separate test).\n- When multiple frames are dropped simultaneously and the callback has a value greater than 1 as argument.\n- When frames are dropped because of ClearFramesAndHistory",
