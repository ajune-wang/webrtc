Most of these aren\u0027t a clear indication of good or bad in isolation unfortunately.\n\nMy thinking here is:\n- higher media bitrate, generally good\n- less padding used, generally good\n- rtx used to improve media, better than sending padding, if one has to choose one (sending nothing is best though)\n- rtx padding, same reasoning as regular padding\n\nI could definitely go with SmallerIsBetter for media rtx too.",

      "message": "Ok, that makes sense. I was worrying about the scenario where \"ramp-up-rtx-media-sent\" increases (a regression compared to sending nothing) and the system will consider this an improvement.\n\nOn the other hand, if that happens we are probably going to see \"ramp-up-media-sent\" decrease (since we have to retransmit more) and the the system will flag the regression anyway.\n\nDoes it make sense or there could be situations where \"ramp-up-media-sent\" is unchanged and we just retransmit more?",
