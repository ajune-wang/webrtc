      "message": "I tested screencapture on 100.0.4896.30 and even though we\u0027re behind a flag I don\u0027t think this meets the bar for merging. I played a video on the monitor that I was not interacting with, and while the mouse did get \"stuck\" in it\u0027s last known position from that monitor, the content did still update/capture appropriately. I didn\u0027t build with this fix, but I would guess that this just fixes the mouse cursor being stuck, and so since we aren\u0027t enabled by default it seems like a cosmetic issue that isn\u0027t worth pursuing a merge for at this phase.\n\n(I\u0027m assuming the repro case would be to do capture without the cursor being on the screen, correct me if I\u0027m wrong about that)",
