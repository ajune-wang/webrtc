      "message": "I wanted to avoid duplication, and figured it was fine if the binary expands for a day until I reland the follow-up CL. If you\u0027d prefer that, I could instead keep RTC_LOG_V separate for now and merge them in a later CL.\n\nNow that I think about it more, this will cause rebase errors for that CL, so maybe it\u0027s easier to add RTC_LOG_FILE_LINE as a copy of RTC_LOG and consolidate them later after all.",
