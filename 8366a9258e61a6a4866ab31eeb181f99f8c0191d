      "message": "Alex/Jan, I moved the renegotiation for resolution outside the buffer processing method in the hope that resolution is adjusted as soon as the `SetResolution` method is invoked on the stream rather than waiting for stream buffer processing (which seems to happen if anything changes on the screen e.g. mouse movement) though I still see the resize happen only on input change. Kindly take another look when you get some time. Thanks!",
