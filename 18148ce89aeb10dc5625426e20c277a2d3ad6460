      "message": "No, this won\u0027t register.\n\nUsage patterns, which are bitfields, are filtered against a \"suspiciousness filter\" before being reported. I\u0027ve had on my \"good ideas we should do\" to do the paperwork for recording all usage patterns, not just the suspicious ones, but haven\u0027t done so yet.\n\nWhat\u0027s the data you want? Whether it is used at all, or which sites use it?\n\nYou should be recording an UMA histogram for the former. The latter may require an UKM metric - either a bit in the usage pattern once we generalize it, or a new UKM metric.",
