      "message": "As Jonas points out, this additional comment is highlighting what has already been called out in the lines directly above.\n\nTo me it sounds like a bug was discovered in an implementation that deleted a reference counted object from within a callback from that object. That\u0027s a pattern to be avoided and arguably not unique to DataChannelObserver.\n\nPossibly related to the problem, CallbackList allows for removing subscriptions from within callbacks - is that relevant to the original problem?",

It seems strange to me that someone reacting to an event have to take precaution even if that event handler is not referencing the data channel directly. Considering \"re-entrancy is not supported\" (comment above) it probably wouldn\u0027t naturally hold a reference here",
