In addition to the ICE and STUN RFCs, are there other (maybe internal) references I should be aware of to make sure the numeric value below does not conflict with some other extended attributes?\n2. Do I need any public announcement of the new field so that there is no conflict in the future from endpoints with different implementation?",
