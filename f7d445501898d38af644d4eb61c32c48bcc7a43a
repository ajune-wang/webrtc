      "message": "I worry that changing these to info-level will produce too many log messages; the ICE stack already produces a lot of info-level logs as is. I did a brief test and found that the size of logs generated by P2PTransportChannel tests increased by about 20% with this change.\n\nAre there specific use cases where these log statements would have been helpful? Would it be possible to add more targeted log statements to address those cases, which would occur less frequently but convey more useful information? Maybe going back to my old idea of logging things like \"Changing selected candidate pair from X to Y due to incoming connectivity check being received\". That would also have the advantage that it would be easier for someone not familiar with this code to read the log and understand what happened.",
