From my experience, the only thing that will happen is that it will inline a loop-implementation and no special optimization is done.\n\nCan we write code that performs significantly better compared to std::inner_product?\n\nIf I understand correctly, you\u0027re suggesting that we add our own implementation of std::inner_product and the reason for that is the chance to write sth faster than the std function.\n\nI can benchmark that alternative, but in general I prefer to avoid expanding such a function because IMO using std::inner_product reads better and it\u0027s less error prone.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e However, with the current implementation the call to inner_product hides how the nested loop likes like (i is included in the call and end-iterators are used.\n\nNote that that was already the case: the code I changed has a for loop which calls std::inner_product plus a circular buffer shit op. Now we essentially have a for loop with std::inner_product only - so everything according to the CL description. So, the new impl doesn\u0027t hide anything that previously was not hidden.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e My suggestion is therefore to instead of using the inner_product write out the actual loops. That will make it more clear to see whether the loops are optimized fully.\n\nFor sure one good thing of having the actual loops is that we can better assess temporal/spatial locality to reduce cache miss.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Same comment goes for the line 134.\n\nI\u0027ll benchmark the alternative you suggest, but feel free to reply in the meantime.",

      "message": "|Can we write code that performs significantly better compared to std::inner_product?\nYes, we checked what these do about a year ago and these map to plain C++ loops which are then compiled. So just writing it in a C++ loop will work fine.\n\n|If I understand correctly, you\u0027re suggesting that we add our own |implementation of std::inner_product and the reason for that is the chance to |write sth faster than the std function.\n\nFrom what I\u0027ve seen, the std function does not add any customized optimizations, i.e., I strongly doubt that it is faster than a well-written C++ loop. If those loops are written in a clean manner, compilers are really good at optimizing them.\n\nMy main concerns here are that you are creating a double loop where the inner loop criterion is based on std::inner_product and it is very hard, at least for me, to see how the loop-criterions affect each other.\n\nI\u0027d definitely prefer to avoid the inner_product because I think it reduces readability.\n\nOne aspect that actually may improve the speed of the loop is that the iterators for x likely need to be reinitialized for each call, even though the size of x is never changed.",
