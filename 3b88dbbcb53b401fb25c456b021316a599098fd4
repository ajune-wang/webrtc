      "message": "usrsctp was already including its include path in its public_configs, but it was including usrsctplib directly rather than the parent directory. Also, I couldn\u0027t include the full third_party path since it differs inside and outside chromium (chromium includes an extra \"usrsctplib\"). So is this okay?",

      "message": "Ah, the different path is unfortunate.\n\nI think we should still use \"\" instead of \u003c\u003e since this is not a system header but we still #include the one from third_party.\n\nAnother option is to keep:\n\n  #include \"usrsctplib/usrsctp.h\"\n\nAnd let clients set the correct include_dir (-I compiler flag) to the folder that contains the usrsctplib, so that \"usrsctplib/usrsctp.h\" will be found and we keep a folder in the #include, which is always good for dependencies.",
