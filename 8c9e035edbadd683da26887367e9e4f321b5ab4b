Sadly we have SctpDataContentDescription inheriting from MediaContentDescription, probably because of RTP data channels...\n\nAfter removing the template argument it should be possible to merge this (which primarily adds Codecs) to MediaContentDescription?",

I think moving codecs up in the hierarchy makes sense but that needs to be driven by refactoring that simplifies and removes a few downcasts, not by my opinion ;-)",
