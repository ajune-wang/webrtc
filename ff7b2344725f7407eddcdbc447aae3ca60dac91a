      "message": "This will be even harder to fix now. Have any ideas? This is currently thread-safe because it\u0027s always called from a network_thread-\u003eInvoke *while on the worker thread*, but there\u0027s no way to enforce that.\n\nI could call a method \"GetRtpDemuxerCriteria\" on the worker thread, and then pass that as an argument to UpdateRtpTransport on the network thread. Though that breaks encapsulation even more.\n\nAnother idea: SetLocalContent/SetRemoteContent could return an std::function\u003cRTCError()\u003e representing the work still remaining to be done on the network thread.",

      "message": "The standard solution to this kind of issue is to install a copy on the other thread, but that doesn\u0027t work in this case.\n\nThe complication with demuxer_criteria_ isn\u0027t really the installation, it\u0027s that the criteria are modified based on incoming RTP data when we register non-negotiated tracks, so the data we should start changing when updating isn\u0027t the same data as when we installed it.\nShows what happens when you don\u0027t start off with thread annotations, and people make ad-hoc changes that work \"nearly all the time\".\n\nSuggest to leave in the TODO for now.",
