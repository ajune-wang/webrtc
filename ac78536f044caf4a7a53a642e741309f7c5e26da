I asked around on my team to see if there is someone who knows this area better.\n\nI did notice that this patch is using the rtc_pipewire_version buildflag you\u0027re removing in your other patch, so you might want to land that one first and rebase.",

I already got some feedback from people outside WebRTC and the code I use is used in similar manner in other related projects so I believe it should work just fine, but having an approval from someone from WebRTC would\u0027t hurt.",
