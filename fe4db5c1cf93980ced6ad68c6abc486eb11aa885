      "message": "Agreed, but I can\u0027t figure out how a helper would make things clearer. Now the variables are expressed in terms of send/recv which I think makes the code easier to reason about. With a generic helper they would probably be referred to as just local/remote instead.\n\nAlso, in the long run I don\u0027t think we need this behavior at all. But I decided to keep it for now while fixing the bug instead of opening that can of worms.",
