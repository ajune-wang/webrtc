      "message": "PTAL. The different approach of codecs handling scalability mode in video_codec_initializer is the most confusing part for me, especially when simulcast is involved.\n\nFor example, For AV1, in video_codec_initializer.cc, it calls SetAV1SvcConfig() with the last simulcast layer\u0027s num_temporal_layers, and then use this num_temporal_layer information to set the top-level video_codec scalability mode. in SetAv1SvcConfig. Why that? What if application sets different scalability mode for different simulcast layers?\n\nAlso it seems whether num_temporal_layers and scalability_mode setting at each simulcat layer is already configured or not when SetupCodec is called is very undeterministic,which makes the attempt to enable simulcast temporal scalability difficult.",
