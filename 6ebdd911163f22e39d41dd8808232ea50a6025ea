We can\u0027t change the downstream until the upstream change has landed, and the bots will refuse the update until the downstream is updated.\n\nI think we\u0027ll have to do this in a multi-step dance:\n\n- Add a new interface function \"functionWithOldSignature\"\n- Roll into downstream\n- Change downstream to call \"functionWithOldSignature\"\n- Change the old interface function to a new signature (this CL)\n- Change downstream to call the new interface function\n- Remove \"FunctionWithOldSignature\"\n\nAdding mirko, our roll-and-update expert, to see if he sees simpler ways forward (can we land this, force-commit and break the build, and then fix downstream?)\n\nAll because C++ is unable to discriminate on return type...",
