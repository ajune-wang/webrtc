      "message": "This condition mimics what the code a couple of lines above was doing before we moved it.\n\nIt\u0027s a strange condition though: if `encodings.size() \u003e 1` then it doesn\u0027t matter whether `encodings[0].max_bitrate_bps` was specified. I doubt this was on purpose considering {active,inactive} is a valid singlecast use case.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how widely used \"x-google-max-bitrate\" is but I would prefer that we remove any condition where we see a subtle difference between {active} and {active,inactive}.\n\nWDYT about relaxing this condition, either in this CL or as a follow-up?",
