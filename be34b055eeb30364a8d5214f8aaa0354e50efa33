      "message": "Personally I welcome removing and thus defaulting various constructors for structs, but not for classes.\n\nI would suggest to keep existent conststurctors (but won\u0027t mind if you move `\u003d default` to the header from .cc file.\n\nIf you want to improve the constructors, then you may fix this class to follow \nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Copyable_Movable_Types\n\n\"Every class\u0027s public interface must make clear which copy and move operations the class supports. This should usually take the form of explicitly declaring and/or deleting the appropriate operations in the public section of the declaration.\"\n...\nThese declarations/deletions can be omitted only if they are obvious:\n\nIf the class has no private section, like a struct or an interface-only base class, then the copyability/movability can be determined by the copyability/movability of any public data members.",
