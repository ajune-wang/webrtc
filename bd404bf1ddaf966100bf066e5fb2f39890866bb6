To make https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/api/crypto/crypto_options.h;l\u003d58;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d0 `mutable`\n2. To define a field trial in chromium instead of webrtc.\n\nSo I think this is the best, but please have a look and let me know :)",

      "message": "Are there A/B plans for this or is this just an opt-in? We can use field trials for experimentations but we should not use it as a flag to turn something on or off, for that we can add booleans to RTCConfiguration or just change the default behavior.\n\nFor the code that says \"if offer was encrypt, answer is also encrypt\" I think we can just change this behavior to default true. It is then up to the offerer about whether or not to turn on encryption.\n\nAs for how the offerer controls this, the app already controls which header extensions to negotiate (either via `setHeaderExtensionsToNegotiate` or via SDP munging) and this decision happens on a per-peer connection basis (not a global config).\n\nSo what is the field trial doing? Is it affecting default behavior of the peer connection?",
