      "message": "I\u0027d prefer to not have yet another enum representing codec type. It seems needed to be able to say \"raw\" to RtpPacketizer::Create, which in it self is a somewhat questionable interface (it would be better to register some object knowing how to packetize once per payload type, and not have a Create(...) { switch (codec_type) { create appropriate objects } } once per packet.",

      "message": "The reason why I added another enum was to avoid confusion since VideoCodecType is used in many other places. I agree that it would be good to change the interface (perhaps that can be done in a follow-up CL). For now, do you think it is better to add a new value to VideoCodecType instead?",
