# API header files

As a user of the WebRTC library, you may use headers and build files
in the following directories:

Directory                                  | Note

While the files, types, functions, macros, build targets, etc. in
these directories will sometimes undergo incompatible changes, such
changes will be announced in advance to
[discuss-webrtc@googlegroups.com][discuss-webrtc], and a migration
path will be provided.

[discuss-webrtc]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/discuss-webrtc

In the directories not listed in the table above (including
subdirectores of the listed directories, unless noted in the table),
incompatible changes may happen at any time, and are not announced.

## All these worlds are yoursâ€”except Europa

In the API headers, or in files included by the API headers, there are
types, functions, namespaces, etc. that have `impl` or `internal` in
their names (in various styles, such as `CamelCaseImpl`,
`snake_case_impl`). They are not part of the API, and may change
incompatibly at any time; do not use them.
