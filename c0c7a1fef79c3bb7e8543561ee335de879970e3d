      "message": "Would it perhaps be better to land this with some active killswitch, and only remove the killswitch when the fixes have been landed for all platforms? The concern that this intends to address is that, a programmer working on Mac and relying on the documentation of TQ could end up not realizing that this is not true for Linux/Windows yet, and end up writing and debugging code which works as expected on his system, but not elsewhere.",

Shall I file a separate bug, or is this ambiguity an artifact of my thinking?",
