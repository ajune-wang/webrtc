      "message": "This slightly changes the behaviour: OnFailure callback might trigger after peer connection is destroyed where before it would be triggered during peer connection destructor, but it still would trigger [unless signalling thread itself is stopped]\n\nI can keep the old behavior, but that adds extra complexity that I do not think is needed.\n\nI\u0027ve also considered to do a more radical change (https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/272001) but that also changes expectation for legacy callbacks, I\u0027m not sure if those changes are ok, and I prefer to keep functional changes at minimum during refactoring like this one.",
