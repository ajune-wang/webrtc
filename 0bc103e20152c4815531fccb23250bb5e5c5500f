      "message": "+R sprang@ WDYT?\n\nI\u0027m a little against this change.\n\n\nMax bitrate is bigger than target mainly for a different reason:\nit\u0027s to facilitate bandwidth estimation ramp-up up-to the point where higher simulcast streams will be enabled.\n\nOf course, giving a better quality and better utilization of the available bandwidth is a reason too, but that\u0027s mostly a bonus.\n\nThis max bitrate is usually considered to be wasteful, so sending up-to max bitrate for all the streams may not be a great idea. If the user would like to get a better quality, they should increase the target bitrate instead (there\u0027s even WebAPI for that). There\u0027s always a trade off: users want quality, but at the same time, they want not to use extreme amount of bandwidth.\n\nFor that reason, default configured bitrates have MAX\u003d\u003dTARGET for supposed top layers [1].\n\nAlso, sending all max bitrates might be a bad configuration for SFUs in conference scenario. Lower streams are there for participants with constrained downlinks. Increasing bitrates at the lower layers would result in lower resolution and frame-rate selected for such users.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/media/engine/simulcast.cc;l\u003d94;drc\u003d2afff37ba007429cd1cb65369ee815bceee6f3c9\n\n\n",
