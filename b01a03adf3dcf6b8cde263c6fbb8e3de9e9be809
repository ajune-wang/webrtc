I\u0027m pretty sure that everything compared in operator\u003d\u003d is in that category, so you should be using operator\u003d\u003d (the AudioCodec and VideoCodec specific versions).\n\nMatches and IsSameCodecSpecific are only looking at *the parameters that uniquely identify a codec*; in other words the things that need to be the same between the offer and answer. For the most part it\u0027s fine to have different FMTP parameters in different directions, except for things like packetization-mode.\n\nBut *for a given direction*, RFC 8859 seems pretty clear that all the parameters in different m\u003d sections need to be identical.
