There is something relevant in presubmit hooks, but \u0027git commit --amend\u0027 shows no result. Google search reads either testing of an app with webrtc, or (as I understand) end-to-end testing, not unittests.\n\nCould you please provide an appropriate command-line or a link to the relevant docs?",
