      "message": "To call StopPlayout() without being initialized is benign, for all platforms, the following scheme is used in StopPlayout:\n\nif (!initialized_ || !playing_) {\n  return 0;\n}\n\nRegarding the second comment, if the idea is to remove Init and include it in to Start, it is a great long-term idea but it would be lots of work to implement it and I kindly ask for OK not to do that sort of work in this context. Doing so would also remove the existing possibility to use Init as \"Prepare\" to speed up the Start phase.",
