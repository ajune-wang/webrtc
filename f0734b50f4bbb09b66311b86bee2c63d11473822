The problem here is that _captureStarted is used off the API thread in VideoCaptureModuleV4L2::CaptureProcess.\n\nYou might have to split _captureStarted into one API-thread-only member (api_checker), and one capture-only (capture_checker) member. Or involve the mutex, but it\u0027d be a bigger change.",
