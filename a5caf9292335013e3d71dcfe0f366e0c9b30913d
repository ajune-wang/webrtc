      "message": "I have an upcoming CL that adds an enum type and a getter to Candidate and I was initially thinking of using `IceCandidateType` for this but that enumeration has `kUnknown` and `kNumValues` as possible values and I was hoping to only have valid values in the enumeration.\n\nSo the approach I\u0027m currently thinking of taking is to have a type in candidate.h that is just `webrtc::CandidateType` and as a later step consider to replace `IceCandidateType` with that type if we can get rid of kUnknown and kNumValues. The value of having only valid values being that we can get compile time values when a function doesn\u0027t cover all the possible values as well as encourage initializing variables to valid values at construction time.\n\nThoughts?\n\nFor now, I renamed this to GetRtcEventLogCandidateType().",
