      "message": "I did think about this but I am not sure what is better/worse. Munging is against the standard, but so is supporting BUNDLE without supporting MID, so we\u0027re already in legacy land.\n\nI was trying to pick the lesser of two evils:\n\n- On one hand, if we turn of PT at offer time only to turn it back on at answer time due to the answerer removing the MID, we lose out on packets during negotiation for legacy endpoints. The SDP munging avoids that, but it does require munging.\n\n- On the other hand, if we don\u0027t turn off PT at offer time, we force popular SSRC-based services to always negotiate with dummy m\u003d sections which might not be obvious that you have to do since this is racy.\n\nIdeally, I don\u0027t want to force SSRC endpoints to use dummy m\u003d sections.\n\nBut it\u0027s not nice if every negotiation temporarily disables PT demuxing for clients that do want PT demuxing and don\u0027t want to SDP munge either.\n\nWhat do you think about this compromise: Once we have received an answer that turns PT demuxing on, from that point on we allow PT demuxing for all follow-up offers and answers? Then this is only an initial one-time setup for early media for legacy endpoints.",

      "message": "Also I just realized that if you are the offerer and want PT demuxing, you ALREADY have to SDP munge because by default the payload types are not unique. So any user of offer-with-PT-demux is already an SDP munger. And otherwise if you are the answerer then SDP munging does not apply to you.\n\nIf we add a boolean that says \"once PT has been disabled, we always allow PT\" then there is no issue with follow-up offers and answers.",
