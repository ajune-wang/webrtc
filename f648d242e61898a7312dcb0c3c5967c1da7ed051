      "message": "Please don\u0027t add any method to the new interface. There is a high risk people will start using it. The current code is very bloated, but it\u0027s written that way so we could avoid adding this method to the new interface and so that we could easily nuke everything once WebRtcVideoDecoderFactory is gone. Anders is actively working on removing WebRtcVideoDecoderFactory and the USE_BUILTIN_SW_CODECS ifdefs. Are the other changes in this CL dependent on you adding this method or can you work around it?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t quite understand the issue; if someone starts using a method that\u0027s slated for removal, and then we remove it, they only have themselves to blame, right?\n\nI can definitely undo this, it just makes this CL cleaner, allowing all the other CreatePeerConnectionFactory overloads to be implemented in terms of the the new one, and moving creation of the \"built-in\" factories to createpeerconnectionfactory.cc. See CL description for more explanation.\n\nHow close is Anders to being done; should I just wait? (I\u0027ll be leaving Google in 2 weeks FYI)",
