      "message": "SetReceiveAudioSink() would be easier to understand IMO - provided I didn\u0027t already misunderstand it! :)\n\nAlso, is it really necessary to share send/receive in the same interface? If there is state for CC etc that needs to be shared, can that live in a shared object instead? Like I said in a previous comment, we have legacy \"duplex\" constructs in some places which we\u0027re trying to get rid of.",

      "message": "I agree it\u0027s preferable to define separate interfaces for send and receive interface, even if we need an all-in-one object for the top-level injection. On the top-level, I think it is reasonable with a class representing the (bidirectional) connection to the remote peer. \n\nOr do you think it makes sense to inject one MediaSendTransport for send streams and a separate MediaReceiveTransport for receive streams?",
