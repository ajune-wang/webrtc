      "message": "Maybe I was a bit too quick. Ownership in this case seems a bit brittle. We pass a refcounted object to SetEncodedData, and the typical usecase, I imagine, will pass this into C++, where we lose control over the life time; I don\u0027t think we can we guarantee that the objc RTCEncodedImage outlives the C++ object? So I think it would be safer to somehow pass ownership to ObjcEncodedImageBuffer, something like\n\nif (!self.encodedData) {\n  self.encodedData \u003d ObjCEncodedImageBuffer::Create(self.buffer)); // Pass ownership\n  self.buffer \u003d [NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:...]; // Shallow copy, no ownership\n}\nencodedImage.SetEncodedData(self.encodedData());",
