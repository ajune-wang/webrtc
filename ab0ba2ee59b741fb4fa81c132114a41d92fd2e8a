      "message": "Say I set all my layers to scale_resolution_down_by to 1.0 (this is legal). The layers will come from GetSimuclastConfig with all width x height divided by 2 for each layer, but the width x height will not be overridden here. Changing to \u003e\u003d 1.0 would fix this, but then you\u0027d have to change the initialized value for VideoStream.scale_resolution_down_by.\n\nI still think it\u0027s worth testing cases for the VideoStreams getting created appropriately here for cases like:\n-1 layer not set (middle/low/high)\n-All layers not set scales down by 2 for each layer (backwards compat)\n-Setting 1.0 for layers keeps width/height",
