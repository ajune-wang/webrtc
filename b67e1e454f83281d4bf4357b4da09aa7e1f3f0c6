      "message": "I like to think of this more as capacity_bps / relative_priority \u003c other.capacity_bps / other.relative_priority. \n\nIt might just be my personal way of looking at things, but to me each observer\u0027s capacity is scaled down by its own relative bitrate. I think I more see it as all buckets being a scaled down and to allocate to those buckets you scale back up by the relative bitrate. The \"flow\" to each is always the relative_bitrate(relative_priority), but the \"total flow\" is the sum of the relative priorities up to a given observer\u0027s capacity.",
