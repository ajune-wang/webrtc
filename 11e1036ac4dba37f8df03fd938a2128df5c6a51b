      "message": "If we keep track of pending transports in JsepTransportController now, doesn\u0027t that make the |mids| superflous? I.e. if JsepTransportController knows which transports should be rolled back, why would you need to tell it about which mids are being rolled back?\n\nCan we make this simply JsepTransportController::RollbackTransports() ?\n\nAlternatively, if PeerConnection needs to tell the controller what is being rolled back, why isn\u0027t PeerConnection telling it about which data channel transports are being rolled back?",

I will have a deeper look then.\n\n\u003ewhy isn\u0027t PeerConnection telling it\nIt looked like in PeerConnection there is no info about created transports. Transports are created in PeerConnection::PushdownTransportDescription, which already jumps into transport controller.",
