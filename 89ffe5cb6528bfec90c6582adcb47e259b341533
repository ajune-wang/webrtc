First, decoded_image is passed as a non-const reference argument to this method, something which is strongly discouraged.\n\nI agree, but this is how DecodedImageCallback API is defined (in video_decoder.h).\n\n\u003e Then it\u0027s captured by value in the lambda, which I imagine implies an extra copy? I\u0027d prefer to not even have to know what mutable means when attached to a lambda, or why it makes the compiler happier...\n\nYes, it\u0027s an extra copy. Using mutable in this case removes const qualification from parameters captured by copy, which I need in order to call set_timestamp_us.\n\n\u003e In any case, VideoFrame is a small and cheap object (with a refcounted pointer to the heavier VideoFrameBuffer). I would recommend not calling set_timestamp_us on the input VideoFrame, but instead simply create another instance,\n\u003e \n\u003e VideoFrame another(decoded_image.video_frame_buffer(), decoded_image.rotation(), frame_info-\u003erender_time_ms * 1000);\n\u003e \n\u003e And if you *really* need rtp time downstream, copy it with \n\u003e \n\u003e   another.set_timestamp(decoded_image.timestamp());\n\u003e \n\u003e If possible, it\u0027s even better if you don\u0027t need to name this temporary object, but instead construct it where it is used, as the argument to OnDecodedFrame.\n\nAfter decoding I need to set the render timestamp, but not the rtp timestamp.",
