Seems like GetDataMid() should return a value in this case, and we should have a separate function for checking whether it is rejected or not.\n\nBut there are six callers to GetDataMid(), so changing this logic would need more care in inspecting those six places.\n\nAdd as a TODO for later cleanup?",
