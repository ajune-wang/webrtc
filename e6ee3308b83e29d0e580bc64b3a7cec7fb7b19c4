      "message": "It\u0027s probably much more rare, but this bug could also theoretically happen with non-recently removed streams.\n\nSuppose we start with one video m\u003d section, which will be configured to receive all video packets, and we\u0027re upgrading to two sections. A packet might be received and enqueued from the second video track before the demux criteria changes, and also before a receive stream is created for it.\n\nThat\u0027s why in my original CL, I just drop any packets if the demux version doesn\u0027t match. I figured it was worth the risk that valid packets from the start of a track are dropped, though that\u0027s debatable.",
