      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is the right place for this logic; it assumes the transport will be added to the group (and specifically the first group), which may not be true of a remote offer from a non-JSEP endpoint. And it leaves things in a temporarily conflicting state where a MID is sharing a transport despite not being included in a group under the BundleManager.\n\nI\u0027d suggest modifying ShouldUpdateBundleGroup/BundleManager::Update such that bundle group(s) will be updated at offer time if they\u0027re pre-existing. Then things will fall out naturally and MaybeCreateJsepTransport won\u0027t even be called in the first place.\n\nAlso, question for hbos: I know we validate that the answer contains valid bundle groups relative to the offer, but do we validate whether a subsequent offer contains valid groups relative to the last answer? Like going from ((1,2),(3,4)) to ((1,3),(2,4))?",
