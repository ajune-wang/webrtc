I understand we don\u0027t want to encourage the use of this function, but maybe it will be useful for other tests.\n\nMaybe it would also be possible to make a helper function for function pointers with a return value using some kind of variadic template:\ntemplate \u003cclass ResultType, class ... Args\u003e\nResultType RunSynchronouslyOnTaskQueue(ResultType (*funtion_pointer)(Args));\nWe have that in Java but it might be too complex/over engineered to implement it in C++ so feel free to ignore.",
