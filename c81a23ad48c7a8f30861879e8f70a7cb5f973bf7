      "message": "How does xdg-desktop-portal handle screen enumeration and selection? When this is built in chromium and there are multiple monitors connected, what would the chromium picker show, a combined desktop as X11 does or multiple screens that user can select from? Here it sounds like xdg-desktop-portal has its own picker? Please help to explain a bit in details.",
