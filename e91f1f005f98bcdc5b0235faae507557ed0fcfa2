      "message": "That\u0027s a good question. I don\u0027t know what compile commands clang-include-cleaner needs and whether there are any corner cases that prevent them from being generated. However, https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/350923 fixes header files without any corresponding cc file, so it would have to be a more complicated corner case. (For example logged_rtp_rtcp.h doesn\u0027t have any corresponding logged_rtp_rtcp.cc file)\n\nThe comment refers to the case where foo.h contains `#include \"bar.h\"` and foo.cc uses `Bar`. If the header is processed first, `#include \"bar.h\"` will be removed, and then `Bar` will be an unrecognized symbol when running include cleaner on the cc file. Processing headers last reduce the risk of this happening.",
