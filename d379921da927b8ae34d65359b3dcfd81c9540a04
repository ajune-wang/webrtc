      "message": "\"Send time\" is only used as x-axis. I am pretty skeptical on why it has to be \"send time\" (presuming that it means when the packets were sent). I think we want to display jitter buffer measures against some \"local time\": arrival time preferably since we calculate the metrics for every received packet -- btw, the loop on line 140 should better loop through data_ to be clearer IMO.",
