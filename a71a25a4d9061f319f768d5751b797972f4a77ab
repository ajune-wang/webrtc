It sounds scary at first sight but maybe it isn\u0027t. What can go wrong here?\nIf the @autorelease behavior changes we will continue to use the old behavior which is probably not a big problem. If objc_autoreleasePoolPush/objc_autoreleasePoolPop gets deprecated or removed we will get a build error on trybots and we will be forced to find another solution but that seems unlikely to happen soon.",
