Both GDbusProxy and GCancellable are objects that need to survive.\n\nWouldn\u0027t a unique_ptr with a custom deleter make more sense API-wise?",

I used the scoper since it seemed consistent with other objects we are managing.\n\nAt any rate, this isn\u0027t a critical change and I am ok to abandon it as well.",
