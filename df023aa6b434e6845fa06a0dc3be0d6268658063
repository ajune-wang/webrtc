I can send out one if you think that is appropriate.\n\nI\u0027ve been working under the assumption that VideoCodec (and lot of other stuff in common_types.h) is considered internal. common_types.h isn\u0027t listed in native-api.md, but it is included indirectly from lots of places.\n\nThe problem here is that RegisterSendPayload needs to know rtp-details, and I want to purge those details from the VideoCodec struct. The replacement is RegisterVideoSendPayload, below. It was added by pbos two years ago, in cl https://codereview.webrtc.org/1725363003.",
