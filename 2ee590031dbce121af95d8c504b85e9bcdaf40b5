First, you need to add more details in comment, so it would be easier to debug possible bug with this dcheck triggered in the future.\n\nThis would happen if there are a lot of decoded frames which are never rendered.\nIt\u0027s not happening right now, but might happen in the future, e.g. in VP9 SVC if we decide to decode all frames of a superframe separately to opportunistically deal with transmission errors. This would also mean that there will be multiple frames with the same timestamp.\n\nMaybe instead of a DCHECK add a limit on the size of this set and remove smallest elements if it\u0027s reached.",
