If we get an RTCP message with sender_ssrc \u003d\u003d 2 and a report block with source_ssrcs \u003d\u003d 1, then that\u0027s relevant to us and the most recent report block for our ssrc.\n\nIf we next get an RTCP message with sender_ssrc \u003d\u003d 3 and a report block also with source_ssrc \u003d\u003d 1, that\u0027s and update for our stream. The previous report, which happened to use a different sender_ssrc, should now be obsolete and no longer interesting. \n\nAs far as I understand, the sender_ssrc of an RTCP message is mostly irrelevant for a PeerConnection.",
