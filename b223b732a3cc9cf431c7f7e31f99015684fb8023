If we can\u0027t control the suffix that\u0027s added ourself, maybe we could either to a preprocessing step before calling the field trial parser where we explicitly remove \"_\\w+\" suffixes coming from finch, or even simpler, add a trailing comma to the parameters string?\n\nEg. \"SomeParam/Enabled,a:4,b:fish,\" -\u003e \"SomeParam/Enabled,a:4,b:fish,_2342342\"",
