      "message": "WRT threading: The reason why transceives()-\u003eList() returns a list by value is that there are other places that iterate over the list and can cause changes to the set of transceivers; doing it this way makes the iteration safe, and the fact that it returns a list of scoped_refptr rather than a list of pointers ensures that the transceivers won\u0027t go away while you\u0027re iterating.\n\nThat said, I agree with Henrik that the TransceiverList class needs to have a sequence checker member, which will end up pointing to the signaling thread; we should enumerate before invoking the network thread, not after.\n\nOther comments below.\n\n\n\n",
