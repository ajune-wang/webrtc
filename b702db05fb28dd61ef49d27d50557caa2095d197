      "message": "I\u0027m no SDP expert, is the SDP format dependent on attributes names, or are they arbitrary? As in, will a parser have different logic depending on the name of a parsed attribute? If so, it makes sense to include attributes.\n\nAbout \"\\r\\nx\" vs \"x\": Does it improve fuzzer performance noticeably? As in, does the fuzzer somewhat quickly find NEW units when running with a corpus with newline-attributes, when continuing after running for a while  with attributes separately?",
