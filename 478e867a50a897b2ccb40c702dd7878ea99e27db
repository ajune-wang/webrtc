      "message": "\u003e Strange that the todo check worked before, since we also put links not usernames into TODOs. Perhaps upstream changed, and the justification didn\u0027t change with it?\n\nI think the regex is wide enough to accept all the text inside the () of the TODO() but the error message didn\u0027t specify bug formats because cpplint is a global tool (potentially used by other projects with different TODO styles).\n \n\u003e Go for it. Add a TODO(bug) to re-enable it?\n\nI thought about this but in order to be actionable we need to change cpplint which I am not sure it is something we want to do. Consider that these lines about TODO style are 9 years old, I am not sure they are going to be updated.\nI suggest we see how this goes, and if this is an issue (e.g. too many code reviews need to point out errors around TODO style, then we write a custom check outside of cpplint).",
