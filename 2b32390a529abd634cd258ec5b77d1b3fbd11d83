      "message": "This isn\u0027t one of the recommended idioms in totw/140.\n\nIt seems the constant is used in only one place, in OveruseFrameDetectorResourceAdaptationModule, where the enum value is used to index an array (which is somewhat questionable)?\n\nI\u0027d suggest deleting the constant, and RTC_CHECK that enum values are in expected range when indexing the array. And maybe change the array to a mapping indexed by enum?",

      "message": "I agree this should be removed. \n\nI prefered std::array to std::unordered_map here because clearing is easier and the size is known at compile time. With a map, methods like ActiveCountsToString can\u0027t be const because operator[] is not const for the map (although you can DCHECK the iterator has a value and use at of course). Additionally std::get\u003c\u003e allows bounds checked access at compile time.\n\nA map is likely cleaner now though as it avoids all the static_casts.",
