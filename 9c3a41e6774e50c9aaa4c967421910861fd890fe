This is probably an improvement IF the thread it\u0027s using is otherwise uncongested, and the overhead of SpawnDetached is somewhat significant.)",

      "message": "I found some crash reports where pthread_create fails on PlatformThread with the error code EAGAIN. To reduce the number of threads used by the application, I\u0027m proposing to use GCD\u0027s built-in concurrent queues [1]. The advantage is that GCD maintains an internal thread pool and spawns threads when needed. I would expect the behavior to be almost identical to creating a thread using PlatformThread.\n\nSince that\u0027s all the suggestion is, I wonder if it\u0027s worth filing a bug.\n\n[1] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452927-dispatch_get_global_queue",
