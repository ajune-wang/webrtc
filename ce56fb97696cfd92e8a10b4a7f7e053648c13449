      "message": "Looks good! There\u0027s just one BUNDLE corner case we may need to handle. Also, it would be great to have a simple integration test at the peerconnection_integrationtests and/or peerconnection_bundle_unittest level.\n\nBy the way, there is some code in peer_connection.cc and sdp_offer_answer.cc that\u0027s not prepared for there being multiple bundle groups. Doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be handled in this CL, but at least keep the bug open until those are also addressed.",
