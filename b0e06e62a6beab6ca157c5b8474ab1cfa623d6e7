(The peer over the WebRTC data channel, in this case, had a private host address and ran the same application in Chrome browser.)\n\n-----",

So we\u0027re not testing the new code path here.\n\nCan you look at adding a test in stun_port_unittest.cc that operates with a mock MdnsResponderProvider and checks that its presence causes the right result?",
