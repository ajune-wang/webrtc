While the second protects the pointed-to object, validating that the lock I remove isn\u0027t needed.\n\nAnd for codec_timer_ below, the pointer is also modified in the Reset method, so would need more refactoring to be made const.\n\nSo I\u0027d prefer to leave const-related refactoring to some other cl.",
