      "message": "I would have expected the docs to also say something to the effect that all you need to do to get a fully working audio processing utility program is to write a main() function that sets up `ap_builder` with the stuff you want in the audio processing pipeline, and then calls AudioprocFloat().\n\nAlso, is the program usage (flags, arguments, etc.) documented anywhere? It would be nice to point at them from here.",

Unfortunately I don\u0027t think we have any proper documentation of the command line flags/arguments (other than running with --help, which I added to the comments), and I\u0027m also not sure if we should really list them all here, since it can easily get out of date when people add/remove flags.",
