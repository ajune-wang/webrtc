They are not the same.\nThere is 1:1 relation between type and uri, but id has a different meaning\n(there is 1:1 relation between uri and id, but that mapping is local to a webrtc session)\n\nRTPExtensionType enum is sort-of internal representation of a known extension uri.\nRtpExtension is designed to also carry uris that are not known.\nfor internal webrtc usage there is RtpHeaderExtensionMap class that does id\u003c-\u003etype mapping.\n",
