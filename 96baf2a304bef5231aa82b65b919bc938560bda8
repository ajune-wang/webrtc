I think I suggested raw pointer here...\n\nSince PeerConnection is reference counted, it\u0027s not obvious to the application when it is safe to delete the strategy (same applies to turn_customizer above). So I\u0027m afraid the safe way is to  change this to unique_ptr. Sorry about that. \n\nAnd then there may be additional complications, if RTCConfiguration is expected to be copyable.",

Coordinate with Jonas who added it, his project is using this feature. And I guess it would be good with a comment on RTCConfiguration saying that it can\u0027t be used to inject pointers to complex objects into webrtc. (It might be fine to have raw pointers to data which is used only for the duration of the CreatePeerConnection method, but unclear to me if that\u0027s ever going to be useful).",
