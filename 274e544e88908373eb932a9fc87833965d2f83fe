      "message": "you may argue that the introduction of this method is irrelevant to this CL. My thought is that, I need to have a function to change \\emph{packet time to log time}, so as to align Neteq stats graph with other graphs. This function better belongs together with the place where \\emph{log time is converted to packet time}, i.e., in class NetEqStreamInput. So I would introduce both LogTimeToPacketTime and PacketTimeToLogTime in this class.",
