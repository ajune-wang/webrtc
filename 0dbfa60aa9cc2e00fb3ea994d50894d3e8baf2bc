      "message": "I don\u0027t think it\u0027s good practice to capture someone else\u0027s thread/queue via TaskQueueBase::Current(), and use to post work to. It\u0027s better to either uses an explicit constructor argument for the tq to use, or refactor so that the posting happens in the class that owns the queue. If you add a tq argument, you have to consider whether or not to dcheck that that constructor is called on that queue; not sure if that\u0027s something you depend on. It\u0027s usually safe to initialize state in the constructor even if that state is intended to be owned by a different thread.",
