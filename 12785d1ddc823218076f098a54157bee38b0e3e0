      "message": "Naming question. Once that\u0027s resolved, I approve.\n\nUltimately the list of negotiated RTP header extensions needs to be on the transport - because that\u0027s where we interpret the incoming extensions according to their negotiated ID. But since tests still pass, I assume that this still works; the copy in the transceiver is good for negotiation.\n\n(Idle speculation: I wonder if we can do away with the whole \"channel\" layer of the abstraction stack. It seems to not add that much value over transports, senders and receivers.)",

      "message": "Hm. It \"feels wrong\" to have an OnNegotiationUpdate method at this level, doing only this thing.\n\nMost of the changes that are being done to a transceiver on negotiation update are done through other methods, and probably all of them are called from SdpOfferAnswer::ApplyRemoteDescription/ApplyLocalDescription.\n\nIf the description said \"TODO(): Move all the updates for transceivers from SdpOfferAnswer::Apply*Description into this method\", I\u0027d be inclined to submit it as-is; if that\u0027s not an appropriate description, then I\u0027d rename it to UpdateNegotiatedHeaderExtensions.",
