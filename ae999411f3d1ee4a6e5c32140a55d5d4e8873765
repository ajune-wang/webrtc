      "message": "The SendImmediateFeedback method is a bit more complex than its name suggests. It depends on config_.rtcp_mode, and will either send a packet with a single rtcp message, or it will send a compound packet including the periodic info, additional info via the caller\u0027s FunctionView argument, and reschedule.\n\nMaybe it would be simpler to have an std::vector\u003cRtcpPacket\u003e (possibly const ref) as argument rather than a FunctionView?\n\nI think it would be nice with either a comment explaining what it does (could go in this cl), or a simpler interface (could be a separate cl).",
