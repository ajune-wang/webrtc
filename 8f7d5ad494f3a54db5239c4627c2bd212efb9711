      "message": "The main reason that the implementation is so complicated is because it was desired to allow logging \"past\" events, i.e. support a use case where logging is \"started\" after a problem has occurred but still capture the events that led up to the problem. For this reason, the most recent events are kept in a cyclic buffer even when the event log is not actively logging.\n\nAfaik, this feature is not used and could be deprecated. However, the cyclic buffer *is used* to ensure that events aren\u0027t lost between PeerConnection creation and the time when StartLogging is called.\n\nLet me look into alternatives.",
