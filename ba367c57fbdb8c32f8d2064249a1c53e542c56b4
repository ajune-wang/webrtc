      "message": "It vanished! ðŸ˜„ I can bring it back though. The biggest value of that check was to avoid the blocking call we used to do. But there is a call tree inside of `SetActiveResetSrtpParams` where we could introduce such a check (e.g. inside `JsepTransportController::SetActiveResetSrtpParams`). I looked into it and for now decided that since it effectively iterates over a relatively small set of objects and sets a bool, that adding a check wouldn\u0027t be the same optimization as it used to be (and that SetConfiguration() calls aren\u0027t frequent enough generally).\n\nBut wdyt, bring it back?",
