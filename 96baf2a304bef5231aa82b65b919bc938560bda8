      "message": "About ownership, there\u0027s been more discussion on ownership of injected objects. I think I suggested raw pointer here...\n\nSince PeerConnection is reference counted, it\u0027s not obvious to the application when it is safe to delete the strategy (same applies to turn_customizer above). So I\u0027m afraid the safe way is to  change this to unique_ptr. Sorry about that. \n\nAnd then there may be additional complications, if RTCConfiguration is expected to be copyable.",

      "message": "Yeah... this could end up being an issue if the bitrate allocation strategy ends up swapped asynchronously in the underlying implementation, which seems like a reasonable possibility. So we may want to return to the original version of the CL that had a dedicated setter and transferred ownership via unique_ptr.\n\nI\u0027ll add a TODO for myself to figure out what to do about TurnCustomizer; it would be nice to fix it before things end up depending on it.\n\nSorry about causing this churn for you, Alex.",
