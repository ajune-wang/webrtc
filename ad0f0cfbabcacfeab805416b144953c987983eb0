      "message": "I understand that two versions are needed [at least for a while], but why fork old version instead of creating a fresh implementation?\n\nalso, may be it would be overall cleaner to do other way around: rename current flexfec parser/builder to something that indicate it is older and discouraged version, and for the spec compliant flexfec implementation use names without suffixes.",
