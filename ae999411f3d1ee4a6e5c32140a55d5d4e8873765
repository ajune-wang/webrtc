      "message": "The SendImmediateFeedback method is a bit more complex than its name suggests. It depends on config_.rtcp_mode, and will either send a packet with a single rtcp message, or it will send a compound packet including the periodic info, additional info via the caller\u0027s FunctionView argument, and reschedule.\n\nMaybe it would be simpler to have an std::vector\u003cRtcpPacket\u003e (possibly const ref) as argument rather than a FunctionView?\n\nI think it would be nice with either a comment explaining what it does (could go in this cl), or a simpler interface (could be a separate cl).",

      "message": "SendImmediateFeedback does as little as it has to to send feedback immediately.\nIn particular it ensures configuration is respected. That imply that in compound mode it should create compound, not a reduced size packet. Creating compound packet implies sending receiver report that implies postponing periodic report.\n\nI\u0027ll put those implementation details comments in follow-up CL together with changing SendImmediateFeedback signature from functional to imperative style (which is more common and thus more readable for c++).",
