      "message": "The model in the spec (which I\u0027d like to reflect in the implementation, for future-direction reasons) is that transceivers know about senders and receivers (they have to), but the senders and receivers shouldn\u0027t need to know that they\u0027re owned by a transceiver (when SDP is not required, transceivers shouldn\u0027t be either).\n\nAs far as I can tell, the sender and receiver DOM objects need to find the transport DOM object for returning as an attribute.",
