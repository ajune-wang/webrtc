      "message": "I think \u003e1 temporal layers should be behind a separate flag. Since this is inside WebRTC that would be a field trial flag.\n\nIn the case of VP9 HW we initially launched L1T1 successfully and had a separate rollout for L1T2 but discovered issues with it so that never launched. It\u0027s good to limit scope for these things to one launch at a time.",
