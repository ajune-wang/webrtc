More detailed background information is available in the referenced bug.  \nSince this change impacts the public API, I will issue a PSA and notify the relevant users, although this field is generally considered DVQA-specific.  \nPlease take a look at the change and let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions. Thanks!",
