For example:\n\n\"Previously, native Android applications would classify VPNs as either type \"ADAPTER_TYPE_UNKNOWN\", or the type of the currently active network (which we assume the VPN is using). Now, they\u0027ll be classified as \"ADAPTER_TYPE_VPN\" whenever possible, separately storing the underlying network type (if the VPN tells us) and using that to prioritize ICE candidates.\n\nThis allows ADAPTER_TYPE_VPN to be used in networkIgnoreMask, to ignore VPNs when gathering ICE candidates.\"",
