      "message": "Looks good ....\nthis will create a bunch of nacks every 20 ms rather than spacing them out randomly over those 20 ms. Is there any risk that this could cause issues (such as congestion or exhaustion of the RTCP budget)?\nMy guesstimator says \"no\" (20 ms is such a short time that it doesn\u0027t matter, and nacks aren\u0027t needed *that* often anyway in the normal case), but I\u0027d like to have reassurance that you\u0027ve considered it.",

      "message": "Thanks. First, I\u0027m not 100% sure about the \"randomly\" statement being fully accurate. Unless I\u0027m missing something, receive streams are created from renegotiation, so they were previously created in a very short time window (which got shorter with your optimizations :-) ). I\u0027m imagining that in the case where a majority of the streams do need to send NACKs, and we have a weak uplink, it\u0027ll not be that much different from before since it takes time to send packets on a weak link.",
