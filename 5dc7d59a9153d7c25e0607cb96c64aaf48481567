      "message": "The sink is set up from the same source, so that\u0027s alright. If there was a way to know if a sink is already assigned for an ssrc, we could check that from the media channel.\n\nThere are \"optimizations\" in this code, that don\u0027t necessarily make sense anymore. E.g. caching an enabled() state on the same thread that the state is stored, or checking that state from a different thread (triggering an invoke) to guard against doing an invoke to that thread.\n\nSo some of these checks may give the appearance that they\u0027re speeding things up, but they don\u0027t necessarily do that. In an upcoming change I\u0027ll be changing where we construct a proxy to the video source object. As is, we go through the proxy from the worker, which causes us to have to do a few thread hops, but it\u0027s not obvious from the code that we\u0027re doing that.",
