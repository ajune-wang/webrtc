      "message": "Hmmm... good point. I guess the answer is that they need to be in `public`, since GN doesn\u0027t have an analog to C++\u0027s friend declarations.\n\nIf you want to keep the header private badly enough (e.g. because this is an API target), you can accomplish this by having all the \"meat\"---including the unit-testees---in a separate internal target where all or most files are in `public`, and let the API target #include stuff from there.\n\nI guess the generalized point here is that since if it merits its own header file, it merits unit tests, the set of non-public headers in any target should be empty, unless the target is a test target that contains its own unit tests. And if an API target gets complex enough that we need to unit test its internal stuff, we should extract an internal target that does all the work.\n\nThis was an excellent question, which seems to demonstrate that the distinction between public and private files is not useful. :-| It could turn into a more formal limit on how much implementation we should allow in API targets, though (answer: little enough that you don\u0027t need to unit test its internals).",

      "message": "Danil\u0027s suggestion looks reasonable. And \"visibility\" is related to C++ friends. If we do it this way, then we\u0027ll have very few \"locally non-public\" header files.\n\nBut I\u0027m not sure it will work. It seems likely that the code in foo_internal will depend on things declared in foo.h, but if we let the foo_internal target depends on the foo target, that gets circular. Typically, only foo.cc but not foo.h would depend on foo_internal.h. So we could split things even more and put foo.h and foo.cc in separate targets, but that violates other gn style rules.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s best to attempt to convert a few of our existing targets first, to see what works out in practice, before trying to formulate the general rules?\n\nI would also be happy with some generally relaxed rules for tests, saying that it\u0027s ok for a test to include any private header files it needs, but that might not be kosher with gn? Or to generally accept a circular dependency between foo and foo_internal.",
