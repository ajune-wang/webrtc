      "message": "Sami, is the transition from Settings-ctor-with-7-params to Settings-ctor-with-8-params something that requires an announcement to discuss-webrtc and allowing people time to react? If so, I\u0027d have to go through an elaborate chain of:\n\n1. Add a static method for constructing the object. Use that static method from video_encoder_wrapper.cc. Transition downstream Google projects to use that the static method.\n2. Announce to discuss-webrtc that we\u0027re transitioning to the method-constructor. Wait.\n3. Remove the old ctor, add a new one, and start using it from video_encoder_wrapper.cc and from downstream Google projects.\n4. Announce again to discuss-webrtc, this time that we\u0027re going back to the normal ctor, but with 8 parameters this time. Wait\n5. Remove the static method.\n\nThis seems a bit excessive to me. Wdyt?",
