For Opus, or for all codecs? Are there audio formats that we want represented in SDP in multiple alternate shapes, varying only in parameters? Will this prevent that?\n\nPlease file a bug and explain more what the goal is.",

      "message": "This payload type mapper is used in voice engine to get (or generate) a payload type for the codecs returned by the codec factory.\n\nThe goal is to use the existing payload type mapping regardless of the format parameters (instead of generating a new type). For example, if I were to change the default codec params for Opus in the codec factory, I don\u0027t want a new payload type to be generated (see test). I don\u0027t see that it should be any different for other codecs.\n\nThe goal is not to have multiple audio formats in the SDP for the same codec (only varying in parameters). I\u0027m honestly not sure what would happen if the codec factory returns multiple versions of the same codec. Is that \"allowed\" in SDP?",
