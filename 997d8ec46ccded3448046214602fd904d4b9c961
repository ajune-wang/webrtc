Can you fix in a separate CL?",

We will hopefully have a fixit soon to remove a bunch of uses of these deprecated encoder factories, and hopefully they can be completely removed in the not too distant future.",

      "message": "Jeremy\u0027s link is to Patch Set 1 which solves the problem my checking if AV1 exists at runtime. What I was attempting to do in Patch Set 2 was to skip the test entirely if AV1 is not supported:\nhttps://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/298021/2\n\nMy thinking was that #if defined(RTC_USE_LIBAOM_AV1_ENCODER) would be better because then the test does not exist when not applicable, as opposed to returning early and PASSING even though we didn\u0027t exercise AV1.\n\nBut either way, I just want the WebRTC importer to be happy. There is an import bot that doesn\u0027t have AV1 causing the test to fail during configuration to use AV1.",
