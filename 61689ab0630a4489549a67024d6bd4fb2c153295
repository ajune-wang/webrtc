In such case it will create streams stats object and in OnFrameCaptured, when we will receive 1st frame in part \"// Ensure stats for this stream exists.\" near line 106 we won\u0027t come inside \"if\", so we will never properly set up stream_last_freeze_end_time_ map. Probably we need to extract that part into separate method and invoke it here too. Sorry for missing it during review.",
