Consider code like this:\n\n  void MyOnConnectedHandler() {\n    SignalConnectEvent();  // triggers a call to OnConnectEvent.\n    connected_ \u003d true;\n  }\n  \nIf inside SignalConnectEvent() we call Close, signal the \u0027close event\u0027 etc, then when we get back to MyOnConnectedHandler, we would end up setting connected_ to true, which would be incorrect.\n\nI can\u0027t find an example of this though, but recursive state notifications feel potentially problematic.",

I see to alternatives that are reasonable to me:\n\n1. Completely ignore return value of DirectSend. In case there\u0027s a network error, that will be detected on next use anyway.\n\n2. Keep the Close+Signal error handling in the current cl. Since these are all internal interfaces, related to the socket servers, maybe we can trust our tests to tell if it works, and detect if later refactoring would violate current assumptions?\n\n\u003e Consider the \"FIX\" comment following the SignalConnectEvent() call.\n\nThat makes me uneasy too.",
