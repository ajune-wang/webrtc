I\u0027m a bit torn whether I want it or not...\n\nCurrently it makes no different since we continue the \"Handle attributes common to SCTP and RTP\" block by else-ifing into SCTP and then RTP specific blocks. Which is a bit ugly but the alternative is to continue after every valid value we parse (e.g. every candidate)",
