This is just a straightforward implementation of step 2.2.8.5 of section 4.4.1.6 \"Set the RTCSessionDescription\" and I don\u0027t see any mention of whether a track has been added or not.\n\nCould you show a series of calls that would cause the problem? When receiving a remote description we always will create some track, so how would we end up with no track?",
