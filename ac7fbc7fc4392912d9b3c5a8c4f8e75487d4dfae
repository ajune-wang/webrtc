Also, a nit that TooManyInitialPingsWithoutResponse(...\u0026 maximum_pings) may also be a better signature given we have TooManyFailures and TooLongWithoutResponse in connection.h.\n\nI\u0027m trying to understand what the rationale is to introduce this new criterion to the sorting and what we expect to change with it. It overlaps in part with the two existing methods above, which are considered in sorting via the writability state.",
