      "message": "Looking at the section \"Constructing A POD\" from https://docs.pipewire.org/page_spa_pod.html It seems like it should be possible to calculate or to dynamically increase this number if needed. Doing something like setting a reasonable default (maybe based on a calculation) and adding auto-scale logic should also be doable; though not sure of the performance trade-off there.\n\nAt the very least it does seem like as a followup maybe we should look at listening for the error that we\u0027ve used too much space and the creation will fail?",
