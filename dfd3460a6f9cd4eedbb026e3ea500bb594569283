I can either land this, then land the upstream fix, then patchset 2 to make this a smooth transition roll,\n\nOR\n\nIf you would not prefer the temporary checkout size increase, we can forgo landing this, I can land the upstream change (this will break the WebRTC roller) and then we can land a single patch that swaps the toolchains.",
