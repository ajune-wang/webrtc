The problem is with the test, not with the feature, and it is exercised by other tests.\n\nI can improve the test in a follow-up CL if you don\u0027t like EXPECT_TRUE_WAIT usage. For example, I can introduce events that the callback function is setting to make EXPECT_EQ safe to use on the test thread.",
