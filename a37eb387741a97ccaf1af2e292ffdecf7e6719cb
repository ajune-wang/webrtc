I tried skipping the constness on some, but then I got several errors for cases where they were called with a const \"this\".\n\nThe correct solution is probably to double-declare the accessors (one const returning a const pointer, one non-const returning a non-const pointer), and then just deal with the places that still don\u0027t compile.\n\nLater CL.\n",
