      "message": "What are the actual observed failures?\n\nI kind of feel that having a framerate of 14 to 20 with an allowed difference of +/- 10 makes the whole test kind of pointless - it\u0027s intended to catch regressions that prevent the max framerate from being achieved. With a delta of 10, we won\u0027t catch much.\n\nCan we instead make the tests probe for circumstances under which the framerate may be impossible and return \"meh\" when that happens?",
