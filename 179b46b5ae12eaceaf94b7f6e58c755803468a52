      "message": "I added Release() to remove the data() accessors (actually to rename them to the version that return references, https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/227084) because they were marked as deprecated and because they were returning a ref to a unique_ptr (something unexpected for a data() method, which usually returns a pointer or a ref), while Release() clearly conveys the idea that ownership is released (here the ScopedMessageData releases its state, while the previous version was moving the private member data_ via exposing it via data()).\n\nDoes this make sense?",
