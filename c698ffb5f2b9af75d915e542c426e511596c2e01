      "message": "Naming nit: This should be \"IsMediaSectionRecyclable\", since it\u0027s a statement about the current state of the media section, not about what happens next.\n\nIf I understand things rightly, if the local browser creates an offer after stopping the transceiver, the local will be \"rejected\" as soon as SLD is called; remote won\u0027t be rejected until SRD is called on the answer - but after that, both will be \"rejected\" until recycle happens.\n\nIf a remote offer contains an offer with a port zero m-line, the corresponding remote content will be \"rejected\" when SRD(offer) is applied, and the local content will be \"rejected\" when SLD(answer) is applied (you can\u0027t refuse a rejection).\n\nWith incoming offers, if a local browser stops a transceiver after SRD(offer), the local description will be \"rejected\" as soon as SLD(answer) is applied, but the remote description will remain unrejected until the next offer/answer cycle (is that right?)\n\nThe upshot of all these musings is that \"rejected\" is going to be inconsistent while not in a stable signalling state, and we should probably document that somewhere.",
