      "message": "It is correct, but a bit misleading.\n\nTraditionally, this filter is mainly there to avoid electrical noise below 100 Hz and a side-effect is that the DC is removed as well.\n\nFor AEC2+AECM it must be active, since the AEC otherwise fails. The same holds for NS. I\u0027m not sure about the AGC though.\n\nThe HP filter is a bit strange in that it maps to a constraint for a high-pass effect that is in the standard. That means that we must support it as a separate effect.\nHowever, I think we could/should force it to be on if either of AEC2/AECM/NS are active so that the high-pass filter is not off by mistake when those are active. This approach is already in place for AEC3.\n\nMy suggestion is to just skip these two comments as I don\u0027t think they add that much.\nWDYT?",
