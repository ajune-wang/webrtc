      "message": "This can happen if unittest tries to create two peerconnections using `BasicNetworkManager`, exchange candidates, and then call GetStats.\n\nIn this case the candidate may have a network type other than `ADAPTER_TYPE_UNKNOWN`, but this code is not taking that into account.\n\nMost tests use `FakeNetworkManager` and by default `FakeNetworkManager.AddInterface` will add an fake network adapter with `ADAPTER_TYPE_UNKNOWN`, so it will not trigger this issue.\n\n\nInstead of deleting the whole else block, I\u0027m going to add a comment like below.\n```\n// network_type, relay_protocol, url, network_adapter_type are not defined\n// in the remote candidate.\n```",

      "message": "Does removing the DCHECK hide a bug (i.e. remote candidates should not have a value so the DCHECK is valid)?\n\nIn my mind, if it is a bug, we should fix the bug instead of hiding the bug. That is update the test so that we don\u0027t hit the DCHECK.\n\nIf it\u0027s not a bug, it sounds like we should be able to handle more adapter types.\n\nAlternatively we could do a LS_WARNING log or something, but just removing the DCHECK seems like hiding a real problem... +Harald for second opinion",
