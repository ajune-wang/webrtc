      "message": "Good point. I guess that since the method\u0027s name contains \"Event\", I\u0027m accustomed to use terms \"fire an event\". To that point, go/sigslot-to-callback-list does even talk about \"firing\" events fwiw. But I subjectively find \"Send\" to be a bit unexpected choice for callbacks even though we already have it in CallbackList.\n\nA concern I have with the \"Send\" prefix however is that we use Send/Post so commonly and there\u0027s an implied message queue. For events, how about using \"Notify\", e.g. `NotifyStreamEvent`? \"Issue\" could also be used together with an event or callback concept.\n\nI figure that should be familiar api language since we have `NotifierInterface` already.",
