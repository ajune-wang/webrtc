What about this instead?\n\n  For historical reasons, `rtc_base` currently contains a mix of files\n  intended to be part of the API and files never intended to be part of\n  the API. We are in the process of cleaning this up, and while doing so\n  we will follow the normal procedure for making API changes when that\n  seems to make sense, but for changes to code that is “obviously” not\n  part of the API we may choose to bypass the red tape.",
