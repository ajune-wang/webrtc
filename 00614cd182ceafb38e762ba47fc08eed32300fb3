      "message": "At one point WebRTC supported versions of iOS that didn\u0027t have Metal, and if that\u0027s still true we might need a more complicated condition here. That isn\u0027t true for Catalyst, which is good because neither OpenGL or OpenGLES are available in Catalyst.\n\nHowever, I updated this for Catalyst just so that we\u0027d pass *something* but I don\u0027t actually know how any of it works. It\u0027s definitely underdocumented, and from what I could glean I don\u0027t think WebRTC is using it in a meaningful way at all. I didn\u0027t want to rock the boat more than I needed to, though. (Anders, if you\u0027re still at Apple maybe you can poke the right people?)",
