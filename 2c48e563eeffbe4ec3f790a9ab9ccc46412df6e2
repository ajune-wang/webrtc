      "message": "Note that this means the the remote is broken, it should ensure that a monotonically increasing clock is used. So if this happens somewhere we should look into why the endpoint provides incorrect values. Obviously, this shouldn\u0027t cause CHECK failures.\n\nMy guess is that the DCHECK was intentional, as it makes sense that we would want to detect such a bug in testing. If we don\u0027t want that, maybe we could change this where the DCHECK is rather than here? I think we have other correction mechanisms in other places, so adding one extra here risks making it harder to debug. Optionally, we could add this, but remove later correction mechanisms.",

      "message": "Yes, there is also a bug at the remote.\n\nThe scenario I hit: remote provided high-precision values for arrive time of the rtp packets, probably from network interface. When network path changed, values made a huge jump (and then continue to monotonically increase with the new base time).\nwebrtc already has a field trial WebRTC-Bwe-ReceiveTimeFix to counter that.\n\nMy understanding that while remote misbehave, such jumps should be rare, so I suggest to do a simple recover.\nEither way, code shouldn\u0027t DCHECK on invalid input from the network.\n\nwithout this fix, provided test crashes:\n# Fatal error in: rtc_base/units/unit_base.h, line 139\n# Check failed: value \u003e\u003d 0\n\nYou think it is better to remove that DCHECK?",
