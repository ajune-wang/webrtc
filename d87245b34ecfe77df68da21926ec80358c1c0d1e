      "message": "1. Both `layer_info.link_utilization_factor` and `weight_sum` are of the `double` type, so this is equivalent to:\n\n```\n      layer_info.link_utilization_factor /\u003d weight_sum;\n```\n\n2. This change seems unrelated to the main goal of this CL (to add supports for inactive (even TL0) temporal layers). What is this change for? I can see this change makes the new code match the original code for the `active_tls_[si] \u003d\u003d 1` case, but the new code behaves differently for the `active_tls_[si] \u003e 1` case because of the division by `weight_sum`.",
