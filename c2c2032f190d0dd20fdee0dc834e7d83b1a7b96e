      "message": "Sorry for not catching this at the previous pass.\n\nThis might lead to a weird situation. Imagine requested_alignment\u003d9, size\u003d2. 18\u003e16 so we will fallback to kMaxAlignment here, which is quite bad. 9 would make more sense here (at least on the top layer the request would be honoured).\n\nI suggest this:\n\nint alignment \u003d requested_alignment;\n// Multiply by 2 while result fits in the constraints.\n// Upto size-1 multiplications are done.\nwhile (size \u003e 1 \u0026\u0026 alignment * 2 \u003c\u003d kMaxAlignment) {\n  alignment *\u003d 2;\n  --size;\n}\nreturn alignment;\n\nAlso, could you please add a test for that case?",
