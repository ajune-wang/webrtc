      "message": "Approved.\n\nOne slightly worrying property is that the number of calls to callbacks_.TimeMillis() is proliferating. But I *think* all of these were formerly being called from SendPackets(). The only reason I can see for pulling this up is that different calls to TimeMillis() from SendPackets() could return different results - is this the reason why?\n\nWe could argue that \"now\" should be injected into the library per-call also from timer driven events rather than via a callout (where the lib itself has no way to control whether the time increments while the library is working). But that would be a larger refactoring.\n\nThis fixes the problem, as far as I can tell.",
