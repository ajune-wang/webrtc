      "message": "This comment does not have any explanatory value and sounds very unsure of itself. Remember that you are allowed to keep a closed PC around forever, which Chrome might do if GC does not happen, so it would not even be unusual for this to happen. GC happening within less than a minute of close() would probably be more uncommon than the other way around.\n\nA better comment would be something like \"This can be null if Close() was called within REPORT_USAGE_PATTERN_DELAY_MS of Initialize() and the peer connection is still alive\", or if that\u0027s too specific, \"between Initialize() and the delayed reporting of usage pattern\".",
