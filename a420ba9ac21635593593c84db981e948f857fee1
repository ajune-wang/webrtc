      "message": "Oh, it seems like we *thought* we agreed, because I was unclear. My intention was to recommend that you replace ::rtc::win with ::rtc::rtc_win (or ::webrtc::webrtc_win, for example), but I worded it loosely enough that it was also possible to interpret it (as you did) as being a recommendation for just ::rtc_win.\n\nSo, to be explicit, these are things we want to do with namespaces:\n\n1. Not make more top-level namespaces. We already have at least three, and we want that number to go down, not up.\n\n2. Not make sub-namespaces that could collide with other people\u0027s top-level namespaces. Because of how C++ name lookup works, having both ::foo and ::webrtc::foo isn\u0027t guaranteed to always be unproblematic. (See https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespace_Names for the current Google C++ style guide rule.)",
