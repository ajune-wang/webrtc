      "message": "This caused problems in the case that both requiredSizeBytes and capacity() were zero. Before this cl, we called VerifyAndAllocate which uses a \u003e comparison, making it a no-op. After the below changes, we get calls to malloc and realloc with size \u003d\u003d 0, which hits assertions in UpdateDataPointers, because malloc(0) returns a non-null pointer (this is up to the C library implementation), but realloc with size \u003d\u003d 0 is equivalent to free, and returns a nullptr.",
