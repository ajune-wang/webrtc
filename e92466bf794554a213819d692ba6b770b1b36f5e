      "message": "This test is a REALLY heavy integration test, but it is the test that led me to discovering the dependency on the sender SSRC in the first place.\n\nThere\u0027s a dependency chain about 4 levels deep on \"a has to be set before b before c before d\" that ends up with populating CaptureStartNtpTime; somewhere near the bottom is a dependency on getting RTCP reports from the \"right\" SSRC.\n\nThe test (which lives in slow_peer_connection_integration_tests) failed when I re-ran the CQ on the flag-flip CL, so I copied it into the test suite that is run with flag both on and off. (This test suite will be deleted once I\u0027ve removed the non-split media channel)\n\nMore direct testing would be preferable :-(",
