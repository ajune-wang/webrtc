      "message": "This mirrors what VideoRtpReceiver::Stop() is alrerady doing. Without this line we would fail PeerConnectionInterfaceTest/PeerConnectionInterfaceTest.RejectMediaContent/1.\n\nEnding the source does end the track, so it is really confusing that there exists both a Stop() and a StopAndEndTrack() in RtpReceiverInternal... they both stop the track, but the timing is a bit different.\n\nI think the only use case of \"stop without ending\" is rollback, which I showed is already not working (with or without this CL): https://crbug.com/webrtc/12653. I suggest we revisit Stop() versus StopAndEndTrack() in that issue, perhaps we can remove StopAndEndTrack() in favor of always doing Stop()... not this CL",
