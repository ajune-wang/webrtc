      "message": "Just trying to understand where the change occurs exactly - the order of calls is the same as before (OnFrameDelivered then OnFrame). Does construction of VideoFrameMetaData affect the timing?\n\nBtw, the CL description makes me think that the CL is reverting the order of \"OnRenderedFrame() before renderer-\u003eOnFrame\" - is that not correct?",

      "message": "Yes, the difference in timing comes from location of VideoFrameMetaData which captures current wall time. Before https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/174220 current time was captured in OnRenderedFrame which was called after renderer.OnFrame.\n\nUpdated the description.",
