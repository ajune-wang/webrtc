      "message": "Hm.\n\nIn this CL, you have (I think) field trials passed by const reference, by pointer, by std::unique_ptr and by copy. It seems that you should have one preferred way to do it, and add comments where that doesn\u0027t fit.\n\nAlso, you aren\u0027t consistent in where you place the field trial argument - I think it would be consistent with previous CLs to place it last every time, both in argument lists (important) and in member variable lists (not so important, and sometimes impossible to go all the way there).\n\nConsistency, while it is the hobgoblin of small minds, is also sometimes a virtue.\n\nHappy slogging!\n",

      "message": "so many trials ... this seems to have the potential for confusion. Main problem is that fallback_trials_ is a dead object after initialization, unless it gets pointed to - but since trials_ is a non-owning pointer, you can\u0027t just create-and-forget, you need to have something with ownership.\n\nVaguely unhpappy, but marking \"resolved\" as I don\u0027t have a good alternative.",
