      "message": "If the initial O/A exchange, i.e. before a BUNDLE group has been accepted, contains a lot of m\u003d sections, would we still end up creating all those transports initially? And would that cause a lot of ICE candidates for that exchange even if not in follow-up exchanges?\n\nI am thinking of apps that negotiate what they want immediately versus apps that do an initial dance only to then do a follow-up. Would \"max-bundle\" be able to save you?",

In other words, the bundle attribute\n   MUST contain all \"m\u003d\" sections that were previously bundled, as long\n   as they are still alive, as well as any new \"m\u003d\" sections.\n\nNote that we can only get here in offers; in an answer, we are not allowed to add m\u003d sections.
