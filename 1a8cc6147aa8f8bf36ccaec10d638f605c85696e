      "message": "Note that some of the files in this diff, (like ilibc/*, or modules/third_party/g711/g711.h, etc.) are actually copy-pasted from external source code. (likely why they were excluded initially in https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/144051) \n\nSo I could see the argument to exclude them from formatting (avoid unnecessary conflicts when \u0027re-copy pasting\u0027/diffing with those sources). But, I also see the argument to format. \n\nThoughts? \n\nI think I\u0027m inclined towards the latter as I consider the copy-paste meaning \u0027we own this now\u0027, plus the actual formatting changes to these files are small, but don\u0027t feel strongly either way",
