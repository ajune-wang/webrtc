      "message": "I think I\u0027ve seen this number called samples_per_channel in much of WebRTC.  IMHO, if we call it sample_count, then sample_count / num_channels should give samples_per_channel.  If we want it to be the number of samples in each channel, we should call it samples_per_channel, so that samples_per_channel * num_channels gives the total sample count.",

      "message": "Isn\u0027t sequence_number chosen by RTP?  It\u0027s basically the RTP packet number, IIRC.  Does it make sense for this to be chosen by the implementation on the send-side (or even receive side if the implementation has some other way to sequence frames, such as the starting_sample_index + sample_count)?\n\nOr is this like the video frame id that we want the media stack to choose for us?",
