      "message": "do we want to protect against programmer error of not matching the Start()/Stop() calls?\n\nI\u0027m thinking that right now, Start/Start/Stop works \"fine\" from the pov of this class (as in no error is raised), but it results in one timer and not a timer being restarted, which might be what the developer expected (but missed making a call to Stop() at some point).\n\nI\u0027m aware of Restart, but that might not be the appropriate API in all cases. E.g if there\u0027s a period during which the developer does not want the timer to be running.",
