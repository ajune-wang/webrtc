      "message": "I\u0027d rather not add back a dependency on build_with_chromium into webrtc build files.\n\nIf there\u0027s a way to adjust chromium\u0027s .gn file to tweak the value of rtc_link_task_queue_impl, or adjust dependencies for fuzzers in some other way, that might work.\n\nThe way I understand these things, even in a fuzzer build of chromium, most of the produced executables, including the main chrome executable, should link with chromium\u0027s TaskQueue implementation. So then we can\u0027t set rtc_link_task_queue to true, it\u0027s too global.\n\nCurrent cl ensures that webrtc fuzzer executables use webrtc\u0027s TaskQueue implementation. That makes sense to me. They probably used to link chromium\u0027s implementation from webrtc_overrides. \n\nIf we really want to keep doing that, we\u0027ll need to handle this in some other way, injecting a dependency on chromium\u0027s target webrtc_overrides:task_queue_impl into webrtc\u0027s fuzzer targets.\nDon\u0027t know how to do that, but it seems messy. Such a change would need to go into the reland of https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/681814, which adds the target in question.",
