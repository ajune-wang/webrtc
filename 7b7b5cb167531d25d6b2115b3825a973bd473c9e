      "message": "One thing I discovered while reading the documentation. It\u0027s most likely not glReadPixels() that fixed the black screen when sharing on Nvidia. The documentation says: \n\nIf a non-zero named buffer object is bound to the GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER target (see glBindBuffer) while a texture image is requested, pixels is treated as a byte offset into the buffer object\u0027s data store.\n\nI got a confirmation for it. It would have worked after we bound a buffer object as we do now with this change. Anyway, we still need to use glReadPixels() as we need to set an offset and apply cropping.",
