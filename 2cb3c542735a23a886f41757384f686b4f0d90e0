OpenSSL\u0027s docs claim it\u0027s not *necessary* to call it (though I don\u0027t know if I fully believe them, having seen some of the internals), but if you do call it, it definitely does something.\n\nI\u0027ll leave to you all whether you want to take OpenSSL at their word, once the BoringSSL blocker is resolved. ðŸ˜Š",
