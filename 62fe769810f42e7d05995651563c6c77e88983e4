      "message": "This is yet another attempt to land this. The previus one failed on:\n1) Unexpected new dependency libepoxy.so.0()(64bit) on distro Fedora [31/32/33] caused by binary chrome\n2) Dependency libepoxy0 (\u003e\u003d 1.0) not satisfiable on distro Debian 10 (Buster) caused by binary chrome\nDependency libdrm2 (\u003e\u003d 2.4.75) not satisfiable on distro Debian 8 (Jessie) caused by binary chrome\n\nThe libepoxy library is used for handlig OpenGL function pointers so I don\u0027t have to dlopen() libGL myself and cast all functions myself. Since it\u0027s better to reduce dependencies, I decided to use glad library instead. This one works the same way, but you can use their website to generate the code to be bundled with your application. I generated code I need for DMA-BUF support and bundled the code here. The generator can be found here [1] and there are projects which already bundle glad library same way I do, for example OBS studio or some 3rd party libraries in Chromium do the same too.\n\nRegarding the libdrm library, I now use dlopen to load it as there is no way how it can be dropped completely.\n\n[1] - https://glad.dav1d.de/\n",
