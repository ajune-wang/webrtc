      "message": "It feels like the ability to explicitly set the vector size would be very handy.\nIf I understand the code correctly, currently the size can only be set at construction or via assignment of another vector, is that correct?\n\nWould it be hard to also allow a resize of the vector content (but limit that to lengths that are lower than the capacity)? \n\nI have a feeling that limiting the way to change the size to not allow a resize will complicate some usecases.",
