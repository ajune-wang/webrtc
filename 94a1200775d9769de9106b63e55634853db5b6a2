      "message": "Kári and Harald thank you very much for review! Just a quick question before I\u0027ll land this CL: what do you think, is it worth for iOS SDK to have default implementation of proposed protocol (e.g. https://gist.github.com/mstyura/566a053f7535948b5a3e6bfedfe6e56b written in Obj-C), if so I could prepare next CL with default implementation of SSL verifier based on OS-provided mechanisms?",

      "message": "The reason we don\u0027t produce a good set of compiled-in certificates is that the idea of compiled-in certificates is a Bad Idea - people should work with either the platform certs or a cert list that\u0027s dynamically loaded from a safe place.\n\n(Some of the READMEs involved say this, but not all)\n\nSo if you have a good way to access the platform certs on IOS, I think providing this into the opensource repo would be a Very Good Idea.
