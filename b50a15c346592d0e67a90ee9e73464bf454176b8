Meaning a variant of \"BasicOneWayAudioRtpSenderAndReceiver\" that uses SRTP and sets keys after creating the sender/receiver.",

      "message": "It would be more future-proof to leave Deinit called by the subclasses. Why? Because it may result in a virtual method being called, indirectly. For example, Deinit calls FlushRtcpMessages_n, which calls SendPacket... Which could theoretically call a virtual method like media_type.",
