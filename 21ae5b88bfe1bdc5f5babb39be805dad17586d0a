      "message": "nit:\nWhen reading this at first, the highlighted part, which I normally assume to be the body of the CL description, seemed to me like an explanation of the preceding part, which I normally assume to be the title. When reading the code, it became apparent that it was rather a description of a necessary step to achieve the goal stated in the title. I would suggest:\n1. Repeat some of the content of the title in the description, with a phrasing that clarifies how the next part of the description relates to it.\n2. Rephrase the highlighted section as [problem description] followed by [solution]. Currently, the problem (timestamps were not previously copied) is not explicitly stated.",
