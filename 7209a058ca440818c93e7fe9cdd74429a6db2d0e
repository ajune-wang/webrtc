Reportedly working in June, see comments https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/223540\n\nCan we land this cl, despite program being in a poor state?\n\nSince PhysicalSocketServer is used for other integration tests on windows, in particular, peer_connection_end_to_end_unittest.cc, it ought to be good enough also for the example program.",
