There\u0027s only a single place where instances are created explicitly, \n\n    rtp_streams.emplace_back(std::move(playout_delay_oracle),\n                             std::move(rtp_rtcp), std::move(sender_video));\n\nand that seems to want a copy constructor.\n\nAnd then the resulting vector is returned, hopefully without any copying.",
