If it happens that someone\u0027s specific expertise is required, reviewers could always add more reviewers themselves.\n\nAlso, contrary to common belief that with many reviewers someone would reply faster, when there are too many people involved everyone tends to think \"this is already covered without me\" and the overall review might take even longer.",
