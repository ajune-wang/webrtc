      "message": "The change you made to the formula for min_bitrate_kbps seems reasonable given AV1\u0027s improved coding efficiency vs. VP9.  FYI, according to the formula, the min_bitrate_kbps value for 320x180 is ~115kbps and for 1280x720 is ~461 kbps.  I don\u0027t know/recall how min_bitrate_kbps parameter here affects AV1 video. In particular, I don\u0027t know how it interplays with the AV1 bitrate limits that were recently launched?",
