      "message": "This will fail if the code that calls SetDefaultOutputVolume() notices that it\u0027s already at the desired value. I take it this is expected to be triggered by setting the media channel to null?\n\nThis is a bit weird in a GMock context, this will also be satisfied if the SetDefaultOutputVolume() is called twice from the destructor, .Times(2) would give exactly the same test result.",

      "message": "Yes, that\u0027s the correct understanding.\n\nThe reason I chose to go with the 2x Times(1) approach instead of Times(2) is to decouple the call that happens as a result of clearing the media channel object from the action that happens as a result of disabling the track. I figured that would make the goals of the tests easier to parse.",
