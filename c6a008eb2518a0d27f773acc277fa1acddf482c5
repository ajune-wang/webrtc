      "message": "If the initial O/A exchange, i.e. before a BUNDLE group has been accepted, contains a lot of m\u003d sections, would we still end up creating all those transports initially? And would that cause a lot of ICE candidates for that exchange even if not in follow-up exchanges?\n\nI am thinking of apps that negotiate what they want immediately versus apps that do an initial dance only to then do a follow-up. Would \"max-bundle\" be able to save you?",

It\u0027s probably not very popular, but the issue to support it had 14 stars (https://crbug.com/webrtc/10208) so we should probably not break that use case.\n\nDo we need to sanity check that this m\u003d section is supposed to be part of this group?",
