      "message": "It\u0027s not obvious to me that the cost of posting a task is high enough to matter compared to the cost of decoding a frame, sometimes posting a task also means that real time behavior is improved (for instance, after posting a task, we can report status directly without waiting for the decode) so without digging deeper I\u0027d be worried that a change like this have unforeseen consequences. Might be worth doing it under experiment to be sure.\n\nAssuming it is worth it though, I\u0027m not sure that I\u0027m the right person to look at this. My connection to the code is that I made a somewhat direct port of the thread based version that was previously used to a TaskQueue based version, where i dealt by uncertainties regarding timing etc, but trying to preserve it. However at least at the time philipel@ had a lot better understanding of the expected behavior.",
