      "message": "In the spec, RTCRtpStreamStats contains less members, only:\n\ndictionary RTCRtpStreamStats : RTCStats {\n             required unsigned long       ssrc;\n             required DOMString           kind;\n             DOMString           transportId;\n             DOMString           codecId;\n};\n\nSo I think the following members should be moved to both RTCInboundRtpStreamStats and RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats in order to match the spec:\n- firCount\n- pliCount\n- nackCount\n- sliCount\n- qpSum\n\nOtherwise, these would be exposed to RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats as well (though it would only be visible in C++ because we never defined these for that dictionary). So can we move these in this CL?\n\nThen there are some legacy versions of the metrics:\n- mediaType (which was renamed kind)\n- isRemote (which was deleted from the spec, it\u0027s not even in obsolete section)\n\nI suggest moving them only to the places where they have a defined value today, which is RTCInboundRtpStreamStats and RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats.",

The only thing I am not touching is mediaType which doesn\u0027t exist anywhere now and it seems like it should be removed? If so then I guess it\u0027s perhaps better to leave it in its own CL to remove, perhaps remove with other stats all at once.",
