      "message": "This CL contains a lot of ugly get-it-to-work-with-no-change code, but I think the basic split is the right one. I was pleasantly surprised that both weak pointers and the operations chain moved neatly into the new module with no need for special hacks.\n\nDo you think the approach looks workable?\n",

      "message": "The CL looks like it is mostly moving things, so I\u0027m happy with this as a first step. But see questions asked before I +1 it.\n\nIf there is anything I should take a closer look at do let me know. While I have scrolled through the entire CL, it is obviously too big to look at line-by-line, so if anything changed I would likely have missed it.",

      "message": "You might want to check the logic around PeerConnection.Close(). There\u0027s some moving of stuff there that could use a pair of extra eyes. Also in the destructor of PeerConnection, which turned out to have an interesting interaction with the weak pointers; I think I got it to behave exactly as before, but it wasn\u0027t obvious that it had to be that way.",
