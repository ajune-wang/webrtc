      "message": "I know we usually use absl::optional\u003cstd::string\u003e rather than empty string to mean missing, but RidAndResolution is a test-only struct defined in this file and by not changing rid to absl::optional\u003c\u003e the tests can continue to initialize these structs with as {\"f\", 1280, 720} etc rather than {absl::optional\u003cstd::string\u003e(\"f\"), 1280, 720}. The alternative would be to create a new helper function to use instead of HasOutboundRtpExpectedResolutions() because RID being missing is only applicable when we have a single stream but I didn\u0027t feel like duplicating code",
