In fact this code is already incompatible with (D)TLS 1.3, which you all will need to move to for postquantum. (We\u0027re working on DTLS 1.3 implementation for BoringSSL right now.) (D)TLS 1.3 uses the signature algorithms to negotiate the certificate type.\n\nThough I also see no callers for this, so I\u0027m a little confused what this is for. Is this public API? That may be a problem as this public API will be unsalvageable.\n\nFor dispatching between RSA and ECDSA, BoringSSL has the SSL_CREDENTIAL API:\nhttps://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/ssl.h.html#Credentials\n\nThis API doesn\u0027t exist in OpenSSL, however. OpenSSL has some very weird behavior (that BoringSSL does not have, as it\u0027s kinda broken will things like intermediates and OCSP staples) where you can install one RSA key and one ECDSA key because the APIs to configure things secretly go into different slots. But it\u0027s super buggy because it\u0027s very easy to mix up additional information like the intermediates.",

Is WebRTC checking those signatures? If so, why?\n\nIf it\u0027s the hash of the certificate, that is certainly security-relevant and you all should get SHA-1 out of there. But that has nothing to do with this mediasoup change.\n\nEither way, the question I asked is not a forward-facing one. Does WebRTC, **TODAY** care about supporting SHA-1 and SHA-224 in whatever this context is?\n\nIf the answer is yes, you should fix this by making things work in OpenSSL too.\nIf the answer is no, you should remove it.\nIf removing it would be a behavior change that you need to ask the IETF about, it sounds like the answer for *today* is yes and you should fix the code to enable these hashes in OpenSSL too.\n\nIn none of these outcomes should WebRTC have a BoringSSL vs OpenSSL ifdef.",
