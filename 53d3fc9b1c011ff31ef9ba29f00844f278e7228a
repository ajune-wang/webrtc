Headers are included in the resulting framework, but unfortunately the :metal_objc is not included.\n\nPlease consider adding this target_environment check for sdk/BUILD.gn:\n\n```:1331\nif (rtc_ios_macos_use_opengl_rendering) {\n  deps +\u003d [ \":opengl_ui_objc\" ]\n}\n+if (target_environment \u003d\u003d \"catalyst\") {\n+  deps +\u003d [ \":metal_objc\" ]\n+}\n```\n\nThanks",
