      "message": "I am not fully convinced by adding this method in ControllerManagerImpl, since there is no clear way to create ANA from field trial(s). For example, the order of controllers are critical to ANA. Therefore it is truly the protobuf that can uniquely define an ANA.\n\nBut I am not against the idea of creating a scoped limited ANA through field trials. I only suggest writing a translator from the field trials to protobuf string and using existing API.",
