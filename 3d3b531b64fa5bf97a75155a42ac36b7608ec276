We shouldn\u0027t use it.See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8445#section-8.1.1 - it\u0027s about nominating multiple candidate pairs at the same time.\n\nLite mode is the mode where you don\u0027t send out pings, you just respond to them - useful if you know for sure you\u0027re on a globally reachable IP address.",

      "message": "This only makes a difference with renomination enabled, right? With aggressive nomination, we\u0027ve already set the \"use candidate\" bit on the initial ping, so by the time we receive a connectivity check response, the other peer already knows it should be using that pair.\n\nHowever, with renomination, we don\u0027t use that bit, so in order to be nominated the connection must first be selected and then pinged again.\n\nIs my understanding correct?",
