Does this also cause any surfacing of the state to get posted to blink?\n\nWhether it does or it doesn\u0027t, because stop() is supposed to be a synchronous operation, we can\u0027t wait for a PostTask to tell the blink track to end; it has to end immediately.\n\nWe\u0027ll need to verify in WPTs that the track\u0027s state is updated even if we don\u0027t do any \"awaiting\". Here\u0027s[1] what was done about muting/unmuting FYI, which required chromium layer changes for timing.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/blink/renderer/modules/peerconnection/rtc_peer_connection.cc;l\u003d3160?q\u003drtc_peer_connection.cc\u0026originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F",
