      "message": "Unrelated side-note, but in a 50p meeting filling the send/recv codecs performs ~950 codec.ToCodecParameters() because each m\u003d section will have close to 20 codecs, I suspect there are both send and recv codecs allocated even though the m\u003d sections, so 8+8\u003d16 or more. Each ToCodecParameters() performs a copy of an std::map\u003cstd::string,std::string\u003e for all the rtp parameters.\n\nDespite doing bundle and the codecs being duplicate info, this code is set up to store all the codecs on a per-channel basis.\n\nThere should be room for performance optimizations here, such as storing codecs on a per-transport basis rather than a per-channel basis, or avoiding copies since we nowadays only need to create \"codec\" stats objects for the ones that are currently in-use.\n\n(My previous optimization removed the 900+ codecs on the rtc_stats_collector.cc layer, but not these lower layers.)\n\nAnyway it looks like this CL is not affecting the number of copies, only moving code around.",
