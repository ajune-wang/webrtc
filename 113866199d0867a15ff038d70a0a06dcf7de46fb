      "message": "This sounds like something that SdpOfferAnswerHandler (by its documented responsibilities) should not need to know. Seems a bit strange to have a method like SdpOfferAnswerHandler::CreateVoiceChannel. \n\nFrom a quick look, the only local state needed in CreateVoiceChannel is SdpOfferAnswerHandler::audio_options_, which in turn appears initialized from PeerConnectionDependencies and not accessed for anything else.\n\nIf CreateFooChannel() are moved out of this class (not sure where, but pack to PeerConnection for lack of a better place?) the interface between PeerConnection andSdpOfferAnswerHandler would become leaner, I think.",
