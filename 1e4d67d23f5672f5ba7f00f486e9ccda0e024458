      "message": "Hello Mirko!\n\nCould you please review this CL which fixes generation of CFBundleVersion in WebRTC.framework/Info.plist.\nBefore this change when script was launched by Python 3 it read byte string from stdout, which was transformed to something like b\u0027content\u0027 when converted to string. It caused bad value for CFBundleVersion generated, something like \"b1.0.0\".\n\nThanks a lot in advance,\nYury.",
