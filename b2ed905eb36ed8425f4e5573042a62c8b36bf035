That was really only there to avoid yet another code path for recalculating the overhead when the single-packet queue was active.\n\nThe whole overhead calculation has been removed from the queue, so we don\u0027t need to  care about that and all other operations will work regardless if single-packet or normal queue mode (even with a single packet) is running.",
