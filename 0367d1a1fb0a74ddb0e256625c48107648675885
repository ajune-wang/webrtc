      "message": "Why do we ignore values greater than 20? Do we suspect the client that pushes this value might be buggy? IMHO, a value of 50 might be ill-advised, but it\u0027s up to experimentation to show it, right? I could imagine an ultra-low-bandwidth scenario where someone might really intend it. Or am I missing something?",

      "message": "The motivation of limit this to 20 ms is mostly because this adds extra network delay in case a packet is lost. This 20 ms is set to allow waiting for the \"missing packet\" if the packet was just out of order, in such scenario, we expect it just late for a couple of milliseconds.  \nThis field trial is not used at this moment. Feel free to experiment with this.",
