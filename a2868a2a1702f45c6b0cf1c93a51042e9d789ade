      "message": "Because the return value is a raw pointer and not a scoped_refptr, this could be racy. After the lock is released, but before the caller does anything with the pointer (whether that is invoking on it or wrapping it in a scoped_refptr) another thread could clear the last scoped_refptr to it, deleting the object. The caller of this method now has a dangling pointer.",
