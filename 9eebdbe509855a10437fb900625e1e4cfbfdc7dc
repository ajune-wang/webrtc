      "message": "Hello KÃ¡ri!\n\nI\u0027m currently trying to use WebRTC.framework from Swift for iOS development and found some issues with nulability annotations. I\u0027ve fixed some of the most annoying. Maybe there are some more missing nullable/nonnull, but I didn\u0027t encounter them yet. Will send another CL if found. Could you please review this CL?\n\nThanks a lot in advance,\nYura.",

      "message": "Hello Mirko Bonadei,\n\ncould you please help with presubmit checker? As I see the problem is reported by PRESUBMIT.py due to checker\n```\n    rtc_objc_export \u003d re.compile(r\u0027RTC_OBJC_EXPORT(.|\\n){26}\u0027,\n                                 re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n```\nhave only check 26 character after RTC_OBJC_EXPORT, but RTCCameraVideoCapturer has very long comment and another macro before actual definition of @interface.\n\nCould you please submit this CL into CQ without pre-submit check? Or let me know what is the policy of usage `No-Presubmit: True`, maybe I\u0027m allowed to do myself.\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",
