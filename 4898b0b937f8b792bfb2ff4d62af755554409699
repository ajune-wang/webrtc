      "message": "My understanding was that ClearInternal was an issue because it was called very frequently, and/or with a huge list of messages that needed to be iterated over. So I assumed this would be okay given that it only happens in SLD/SRD.\n\nHowever, it looks like Tommi has been hard at work rooting out any unnecessary instance of ClearInternal regardless of frequency. And given the recent issue of SRD taking a long time with lots of tracks, I don\u0027t want to make the situation worse.\n\nSo I have a new solution which, instead of removing tasks from the thread queue, simply returns early when the tasks are executed.",
