      "message": "Actually, it looks like what we should do is override ParsePayload instead. These two are legacy methods that someone should clean away at some point. (The basic idea there is that NetEQ wants to parse packets immediately and put them in a queue, and then decode them on-demand. In order to make this type safe and nice, we represent the parsed-but-not-yet-decoded packets as instances of EncodedAudioFrame.)\n\n+CC Henrik and Oskar, to verify I\u0027m not making this up. I haven\u0027t touched this code in a while...",

What you\u0027re saying is correct, though. :)\nIf you need to change the behavior of Decode/DecodeRedundant, you should override DecodeInternal och DecodeRedundantInternal, below, instead. I don\u0027t see why changing the old APIs wouldn\u0027t work, but since we want to get rid of \u0027em, don\u0027t use \u0027em!",
