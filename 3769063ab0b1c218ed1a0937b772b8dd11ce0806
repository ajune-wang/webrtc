      "message": "For safety, can we split this CL up? The first, uncontroversal one would implement the API but always trigger the keyframes at all the streams.\n\nThe second one would allow per-stream key-frames in some scenarios. It would be easy to revert later.\n\nI\u0027m not having a second thoughts about this whole idea. We also need to be very careful to not break the PLI and FIR processing, since some SFUs might rely on keyframes generated at all streams when they send a key-frame request on any of them.",

If you have someone new joining that is only prepared to receive the lowest resolution or if you have a single participant switching from a low resolution to a mid resolution you don\u0027t need big keyframes on the high resolution stream.\nIn theory this lowers the number of keyframes and increases the utilization of the available bitrate.

But that will be a different API (and I suspect it will be convoluted because in addition to the ssrc in the packet it will involve the ssrc of the sender associated with it...)",
