      "message": "Hello. Is there anything I can do proceed with rest of review of CL chain?\nI\u0027ve introduced minor change in CL #2 \u0026 #3: extended signature of deliverRecordedData to accept additional argument of `void *` and make it passed into `render_block`. This should provide more freedom to implementation of how to pass extra data in block without additional allocations.\nThanks a lot in advance, Yury.",
