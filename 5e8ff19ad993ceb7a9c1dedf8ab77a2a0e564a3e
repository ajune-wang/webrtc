      "message": "Is the tone buffer surfaced to blink and cached there in an [[internal slot]] or is this just going to be used as a boolean \"is tone buffer empty\"?\n\nI see that the RTCDTMFSender has the same problem as RTCDataChannel et. al. in that its synchronous methods (attribute getters) are doing a blocking invoke on the signaling thread, meaning state information is surfaced prematurely and exposes the fact that the buffer may have been modified in the background.\n\nFor a spec compliant version we should surface all state information in a callback and cache everything in blink.",
