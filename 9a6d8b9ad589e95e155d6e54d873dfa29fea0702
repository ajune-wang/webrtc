      "message": "Is there another pattern that\u0027s more appropriate? The only other option I can think of is a global, and I\u0027m not sure if that would be better.\n\nI made this so the InitFieldTrialsFromString is called only once, as calling it more than once results in a crash (and the FuzzOneInput function is called repeatedly while fuzzing). I thought of putting the call to InitFieldTrialsFromString in the general initialization code for fuzzers in webrtc_fuzzer_main.cc file, but then I decided against it because we probably want to eventually remove this again, and that will be simpler if the changes are confined to this file, instead of spread out.",
