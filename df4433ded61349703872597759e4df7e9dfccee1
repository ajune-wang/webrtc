      "message": "pthatcher@:\nAnother option here is to allow the priority to a double, and still have a default of PriorityType::LOW. This would allow Chrome to use the spec defined PriorityType with 4 values, but applications more flexibility by using any double value for the priority.\n\nI also wanted to address that the priority is specified as a 2 byte unsigned integer with values 128/256/512/1024, although this looks like an intended value for the scheduling \"half\" of the priority.\nEnumeration description:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#dom-rtcprioritytype\nSection 6.4\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-13\n\nI kept it simple initially here, allowing just the 4 values of the enum.\nThoughts?",
