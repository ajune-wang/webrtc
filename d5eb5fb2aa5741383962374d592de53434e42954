      "message": "to me calling 0.5 ms too early looks as bad as calling 2ms too early (same wasted wake up), it is still a bug.\n\nOn the other hand, logging it on every occurrence is probably too much, this class probably not a good place to track libevent task queue bug.\n\nmay be more advance throttling is more appropriate: add a member variable to count number of occurrences and log juest the 1st,  and every 10th (or log every x seconds) together with a number of total hits.",

So it shouldn\u0027t be an issue with a specific task queue implementation.\n\nI saw the following comments in api/task_queue/task_queue_base.h: [1]\n// The task may execute with [-1, 17 + OS induced leeway) ms additional delay.\n\nAccording to this, running a task 1ms earlier than scheduled is not considered a bug.
