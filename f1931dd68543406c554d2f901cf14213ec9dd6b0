My first thought would be to introduce a \"UsrsctpApi\" interface, with a static global default implementation which could be overwritten by a test. It would be convenient if we could just pass this interface into the SctpTransport constructor rather than have a global instance, but currently there are static methods that call usrsctp APIs themselves, so they need something static to refer to.",
