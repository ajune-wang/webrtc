      "message": "\"track.framesPerSecond\" was never implemented...\n\n1. What we had was \"track.framesSent\". To get the same metrics but moved, we need to add \"outbound-rtp.framesSent\". Can we add that? My hope is that if \"outbound-rtp\" has everything that \"track\" did then we can encourage deprecation.\n\n2. But \"outbound-rtp.framesPerSecond\" is indeed in the spec! Implementing that is nice but it is a new feature. Also, since this is defined as \"number of encoded frames during the last second\" and we already have \"outbound-rtp.framesEncoded\", we should be able to cover this with existing metrics. So for the sake of reviewing and landing, can you move framesPerSecond to a separate CL?",
