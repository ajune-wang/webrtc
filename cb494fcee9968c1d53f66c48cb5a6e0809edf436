      "message": "It depends on whether the object owns the state that\u0027s being returned, or if it just points to it. For example, *p may legitimately return different things at different times even if p is a const pointer (but not if it\u0027s a pointer to const).\n\nMy mental model is that a Clock object \"points\" to some source of time, not that it owns it. If Clock had a method to set the time, I would probably reconsider.\n\nWhat side effects are you referring to?",
