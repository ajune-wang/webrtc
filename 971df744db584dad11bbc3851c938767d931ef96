      "message": "It works well, thanks to relying on the number being converted into two-complement. \n\nI have added a lot of test cases to show that it works for negative signed number and for (positive) unsigned numbers. \n\nI also changed the \"-4\" to \"~3\", which has the same bit representation in case anyone else think it\u0027s odd to operate an unsigned number with a signed.",
