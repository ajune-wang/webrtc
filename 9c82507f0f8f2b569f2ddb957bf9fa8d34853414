      "message": "I get your point Karl. I simply like the style where you can read the comment clearly at the entry point, like so:\n\nLogRtcMessage(rtc::LS_INFO, \"%s({ssrc\u003d%u}, {volume\u003d%.2f})\", __func__, ssrc, volume);\n\nInstead of several lines containing \"\u003c\u003c\" operators. Are you OK with something else. Basically I was looking for something like base::StringPrint in Chrome but I could not find it in WebRTC.\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:base/strings/stringprintf.h;l\u003d6?q\u003dstringp\u0026sq\u003d\u0026ss\u003dchromium\u0026originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F \n\nCan you help me achieve what you propose and still keep the style I prefer?",
