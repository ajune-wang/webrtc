      "message": "Why error reporting only for the latter two functions? Because no one checks for errors when opening a file for reading? Or are you waiting for my opinion? (I like it. Not a platonic ideal of interface beauty, but simple, useful, and easy to understand.)",

And I hesitate adding it to all these methods, when it\u0027s only used for one of them.\n\nI\u0027m thinking that it\u0027s easy to add to one method at a time, whenever need arises?",
