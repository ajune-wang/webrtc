      "message": "Ah - here\u0027s the part I was missing when we discussed where to place Metronome.\nTypes that are referenced from api/ should by default be in api/ - they\u0027re externally visible, and we don\u0027t want code outside of webrtc to get into the nasty habit of referencing rtc_base types (which is kind of locking the door after the horse has bolted, but we\u0027re pushing it closed anyway).\n\nCan I ask you to please reverse the previous decision and put the Metronome API back under /api/metronome?",
