Best would be if we could apply/not apply the min bitrate constraint independent of the priority bitrate type, (to me it seems that having a priority bitrate \u003c min bitrate shouldn\u0027t change anything in practice) but if that is really not possible, maybe we could just add a \"bool CapPriorityBitrateByMinBitrate()\" function.",
