(Unfortunately, LaCrOS still exposes itself over the DesktopCapturer Interface, but Ash already deviates from using the NativeDesktopMediaList and Elad and I have also discussed how the NativeDesktopMediaList is getting quite a lot of scenario-specific code added to it that it may be worth investigating a further split).\n\nI believe the opposite is true, that longer-term we\u0027d want to upstream more items to be behind DesktopCapturer (or DesktopCapturerV2).\n\nLMK if you\u0027d like to sync further offline.",
