      "message": "nit: Period at end of comment. Also, we have \"ptime\" on RtpCodecParameters already, so we may want to mention the relationship they\u0027ll have (once they\u0027re implemented). I\u0027d imagine the RtpEncodingParameters value would take precedence over the RtpCodecParameters one if both are set.\n\nThis could happen if, say, the remote endpoint signals in SDP that it would like a ptime of X for a specific codec, but the application then uses setParameters to choose a per-encoding ptime of Y.",
