      "message": "Ok but still add a \"TestMemberIsUndefined\" check and add a comment why we expect it to be undefined. I want the integrationtest to have complete coverage of the stats, even though there are exceptions where something is not fully testable (that is something we could fix with a TODO). It\u0027s good that lack of coverage is also explicit and documented. In the case of \"track\" stats, we make sure all audio members are undefined for video tracks and vice-versa, and that still tests something valid. In this case, verify that we don\u0027t have a relay candidate on a non-relay connection. If the test is every updated to have relay connections the failing test would notify us that something changed and we can remove the todo.",
