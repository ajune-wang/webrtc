      "message": "bitrate_priority can be any value, which is nice because it offers more flexibility than the web API.\n\nBut network_priority currently can only be one of the four values, which did strike me as a strange choice. I would have used an enum but I guess this was done for consistency (both of these use the same enum in chromium, which is then mapped to a double).\n\nDo you think this is worth fixing? Would be easier to fix it now than later, just wasn\u0027t sure if it was worth the effort. \n\n+thaloun (who authored the CL that added this)",
