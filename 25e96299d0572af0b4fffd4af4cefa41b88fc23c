      "message": "Pardon if this is the same question as before, but while I see the purpose of the locks for the media_transport_state_, I\u0027m having trouble seeing it for foo_transport_.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the lock here? Because I see foo_transport()-\u003eSetBlah() all over the place with no locks. It looks like only rtcp_dtls_transport_ is reset, and if it is we have the bug, so I\u0027m not sure the lock achieves much.",

It\u0027s essentially const like the other transports, except that it is reset in one place - but that is in the destructor, only to ensure that it is destroyed before ICE.
