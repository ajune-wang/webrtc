      "message": "Hi,\n\ntrying to convert more NetEq tests, it turns out this isn\u0027t entirely true.\n\nThe method NetEqImpl::DecodeCng, used in the test NetEqImplTest.CodecInternalCng, calls decoder-\u003eDecode() directly. If this code is still relevant, it seems the proxy object needs to forward calls to DecodeInternal (the test fails in the RTC_NOTREACHED) there. And to do that, DecodeInternal probably needs to be public, not protected. Alternatively, Decode could be made virtual, and forwarded instead.",

      "message": "This code is very much production code. It is used to make the decoder instance generate comfort-noise data. If we think it is a better option, we can create a new API method for this use case, say AudioDecoder::GenerateCng (similar to the GeneratePlc method).",

      "message": "Yes---if the only remaining caller always gives this method an empty array of encoded bytes to decode, the right thin to do would be to make a new method for that, I\u0027d say.\n\nWhat\u0027s the difference between comfort noise and packet loss concealment here? Anything besides packets being lost accidentally vs. on purpose? Also, as I recall we designed the signature for GeneratePlc quite recently and were pleased with the result, so would it be reasonable to reuse that signature for GenerateCn?",
