      "message": "This is same change which was already merged and reverted (https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/160649). It also includes a change which was pushed later to prevent build error when is_linux\u003dtrue was used (https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/187122).\n\nAdditionally, it should fix issue where this change prevented WebRTC to be rolled into Chromium. This was caused by including \"linux/xdg_desktop_portal_base.h\" in \"desktop_capturer_options.h\". The include had a dependency on \"#include \u003cgio/gio.h\u003e\" which was not found by Chromium target as it didn\u0027t use \"pkg_config(gio\"). This would of course break anyone including the new WebRTC version. I fixed it by moving the include into \"desktop_capturer_optionc.cc\" together with implementation of XdgDesktopPortal related methods.",
