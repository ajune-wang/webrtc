      "message": "The getStats() API is the wrong place for per-frame metrics due to the performance overhead of calling getStats() often.\n\nWe also strive not to add non-standard metrics, i.e. metrics that are not defined in https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/, a W3C document that is edited via github issues and PRs: https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-stats/issues\n\nWhere best to expose information like this depends on use case I think, if it should be close to the decoder impl or a higher level API.",
