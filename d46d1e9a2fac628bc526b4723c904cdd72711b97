      "message": "I understand that you just want frame information in a generic way, but with this change |frame_id| will now signal if the other members are valid or not (the thing going on at call/rtp_payload_params.cc:250 is a hack that I will remove). That is a bit weird I think.\n\nAnother questions is, how will you signal DTIs in a generic way? By simply not binding the concept of DTI to the generic descriptor?\n\nWDYT about renaming GenericDescriptorInfo to GenericInfo or something similar instead?",
