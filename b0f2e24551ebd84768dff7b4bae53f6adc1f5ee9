      "message": "Thanks for the feedback! This is exactly why I looped you in.\n\nI noticed there were quite a lot of log statements in this code and they all increase the binary size, so I just did a blanket search+replace RTC_LOG-\u003eRTC_DLOG for anything that\u0027s LS_INFO or LS_WARNING. So this is about binary size, not performance.\n\nIf you\u0027re absolutely against this then I\u0027m happy reverting, but but it looks to me as if there\u0027s a log statement in almost every function, when really there should just be for the unexpected/rare circumstances (we do know the code works after all).\n\nYour call!",
