      "message": "I tested the effect landing this CL on today\u0027s Canary (94.0.4605.0). Launching with --force-fieldtrials\u003dWebRTC-Audio-Red-For-Opus/Enabled/ simulates what will be the default with the current CL. Verified using https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/audio/ that (a) Default codec (i.e., Opus without RED) worked and produced about 30 kbps during active speech, and (b) selecting RED worked too and effectively doubled the bitrate.",
