      "message": "Hi Joanna, the roll to WebRTC has been broken for a few days (jansson@ is looking into it) so it is like it has been in pause for 10 days now. :) \n\nThere are probably stacked errors at the moment, so it will take a few more days to untangle.\n\nIf you land https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4666325, and WebRTC doesn\u0027t land this CL what is the risk? IIUC WebRTC will still see the old BUILD.gn files from Chromium (pointing to buildtools) and still sync in buildtools/. Or do we risk a deeper breakage?",
