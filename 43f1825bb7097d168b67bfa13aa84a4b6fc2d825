      "message": "Maybe we should comment on how size is computed and why? It\u0027s a bit unclear at least to me why the size depends on the index. If I however look at where this is called, I can see that fec_index is equal to num_fec_packets - 1, which seems like it could be related to the size of the sub-table.",
