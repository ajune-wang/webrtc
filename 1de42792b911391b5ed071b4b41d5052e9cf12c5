This isn\u0027t really something we\u0027d want to continue doing as they don\u0027t make that much sense given the other options. Is this something we really need to have for media transport?

We don\u0027t need it at this point, as I don\u0027t believe the application that we care about uses it (at this point) (though i didn\u0027t check how is the x-google-max-bitrate propagated down).\n\nAre you saying that we should still call the call_-\u003eGetTransportControllerSend()-\u003eSetSdpBitrateParameters() to synchornize it with the application config?\n\nAnyway, if RTP doesn\u0027t need it, we should remove it. If RTP needs it for backwards compatibility, we should add it to media transport -- because we would like to, eventually, move RTP to the media transport interface (though it\u0027s under discussion whether that will happen soon).",
