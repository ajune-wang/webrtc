      "message": "As much as I hate doing number arithmetic with sequences that can be both out-of-order and wrapped, unfortunately this is the cleanest way of fixing this. I did consider using a time-based approach (see deleted TODO), but choosing the right threshold for different bitrates (also fps, resolutions, fec rate and other factors) becomes a challenge, and brings us back to the same problem. This approach is guaranteed to purge old FEC before media sequences wraps around, irrespective of what the factors are.\n\nPS: I intend to also reduce the threshold from `0x3fff` to a smaller value, because more relaxed this threshold is, more cycles will be spent on old FEC packets before eventually purging them. I\u0027ll wait for some feedback on my algo first ðŸ˜Š",
