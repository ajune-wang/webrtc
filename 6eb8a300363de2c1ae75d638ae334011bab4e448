      "message": "Hello. Is there anything I can do proceed with rest of review of CL chain?\nI\u0027ve introduced minor change in CL #2 \u0026 #3: extended signature of deliverRecordedData to accept additional argument of `void *` and make it passed into `render_block`. This should provide more freedom to implementation of how to pass extra data in block without additional allocations.\nThanks a lot in advance, Yury.",

Technically it\u0027s already enough approvals to land, so if you don\u0027t have time to proper review and don\u0027t mind me landing this CL chain as is let me know please.\n\nThanks a lot in advance,\nYury.",
