Not that ordered maps indexed on pointers and SSRCS has the same problem. If we need to be able to find the \"first\" module anywhere, we can use a vector or list.",

      "message": "There is no concept of \"first\" here. If we reach this point we just want any arbitrary module that can send padding, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth maintaining a separate list.\nAlso note this part is very rarely going to be hit, as last_send_module_ is going to be used as soon as media is sent on a padding-capable module.\nThe previous ordering of modules was implemented in an effort to select the more \"useful\" modules, but it still didn\u0027t really work - and really became obsolete when I introduced last_send_module_.",
