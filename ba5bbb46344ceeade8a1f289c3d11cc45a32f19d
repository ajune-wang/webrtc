      "message": "This looks like a perfect candidate for a map-lookup rather than polling.\n \nThe ideal approach would be to use a map to achieve a construct such as\n\nruntime_messages_[event_msg].WriteEvent(...);\n\nThe second best I think would be to write the code to use a switch-statement to select the correct event.\n\nI don\u0027t like the current approach, where the code polls all the exporters in a for-loop. This is test code, so performance is not an issue but I still think the code becomes more complicated by this approach. One example is that the map and switch approaches will avoid a lot of the boilerplate code required to set up the std::vector\u003cRuntimeSettingExporter\u003e",
