      "message": "Ah, good point, and I overlooked this aspect. It seems I may need a different approach. My first thought was to use something like atomic_histogram_pointer##constant_name, and this would be thread safe and also avoid using a heavy object like map (with possibly locks for thread safety) that keeps the binary size unchanged. The issue is |constant_name| would a string literal in most cases, and the concatenation does not work. Event if I remove the quotes (with some really hacky macro tricks), we need to take care of the case when |constant_name| is a variable, in which case it would be the variable name gets concatenated...",
