      "message": "Side discussion (not a critique of the CL - we need this):\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that we allow turning on extensions in remote SDP despite them not being offered, a behavior many apps (including Meet) depends on.\n\nBut I find it kind of surprising, most things in SDP is something that you offer and then the remote either accepts it (keeps it) or rejects it (removes it). For example the remote can\u0027t add m\u003d sections (though it can add ssrcs on offer-to-receive m\u003d sections, but that\u0027s in the spirit of accepting). In this case you can *add* extensions *not on offer* (or expand the direction beyond what was offered). It seems to go against the idea that the remote accepts/rejects, since this means the remote is in control of what header extensions ends up being used.\n\nI\u0027m curious what JSEP says, if anything goes with header extensions?\nThe remote has no SDP-guarantees that the local pc knows how to interpret the extensions that remote added.",

I refer to this as \"declarative usage\" but can\u0027t find a good reference.\n\nThe corresponding rules in JSEP are in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8829.html#section-5.3.1 and it says:\n  For each supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer...\nIt does not allow a similar thing as for codecs:\n  Any currently available media formats that are not present in the current remote description MUST be added after all existing formats.\n\nThat is a spec bug, just like not allowing to \"grow\" the set again.",

When this API ships it is possible to have all the header extensions you want at offer time without SDP munging, so why would anyone ever need to add stuff to the answer that wasn\u0027t already in the offer?",
