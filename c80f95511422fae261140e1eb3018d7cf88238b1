      "message": "This one is a bit more scary - I imagine there is plenty of code out there that does something like \"if mediaType \u003d\u003d \"audio\" { ... } else { it must be video! }\" that if it suddenly is undefined they would start processing all rtp stats as if they are the same kind even when they are not.\n\nI still like the idea of deleting it, but can you try to do this in a separate CL in case we have to revert it? This decision might also be good to be reviewed separately, for example I would like to see what hta@ thinks about deleting it.",

      "message": "Actually it looks like even Firefox has implemented mediaType. In that case I think all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox) have it already. In this case I\u0027m not sure if it is worth the risk of deleting it since even if you use the wrong name it would work on all platforms. But if we delete it that might break something.",
