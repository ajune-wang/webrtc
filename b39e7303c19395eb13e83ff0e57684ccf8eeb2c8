      "message": "Then we don\u0027t get negative numbers here. I would suggest to either \n\n1. Insert random ids in a large range, something like\n\n  (id \u0026 (std::numeric_limits\u003cint64_t\u003e::max() \u003e\u003e 4)) -  (std::numeric_limits\u003cint64_t\u003e::max() \u003e\u003e 3)\n\n2. Generate ids in the on-wire range, but pass them through the unwrapped to convert them to int64_t, which will then occasionally produce negative numbers. (Then the unwrapping should also be considered part of the object under test, so perhaps a larger change).",
