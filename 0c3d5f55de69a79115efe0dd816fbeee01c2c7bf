Native logging - in this case no JNILogging should be constructed and NativeLogger should be set for Logging.java\n2. Injectable logging - in this case we need to construct JNILogging and the logger needs to be injected to Logging.java\n\nI think we might need to add an enum to represent this difference.\n\nNativeLogger is fundamentally different from injectable loggers because if it was passed to JNILogging this would cause an infinite loop.",

Now it will just log to the first available option in the order Loggable - Native - Fallback.\n\nIt would be nice to have the native logging as an option in the builder, but this would mean a pretty major API change that I would rather not introduce at this point. I guess we could start slowly by allowing activating native logging from the builder as well as from the static method.",
