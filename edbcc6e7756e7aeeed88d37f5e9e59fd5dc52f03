      "message": "This is a good comment, and we should definitely keep it. I just think it would be good to move it. Whoever calls NormalRateAllocation (and please note that the function is private) likely cares more about the difference between ZeroRate, LowRate, NormalRate and MaxRate, than about the inner-workings of a specific one of those, and that with regards to only one of the logic\u0027s parameters (that is to say, there\u0027s also min, max, enfore-min, etc., but relative_bitrate is given preferential treatment here.",
