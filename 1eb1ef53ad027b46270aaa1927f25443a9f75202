      "message": "If we didn\u0027t want to support the possibility of having multiple pending demuxer updates being in-flight at the same time this could have been simplified to a single set that gets cleared at OnDemuxerCriteriaUpdateComplete(). And in fact, because BaseChannel::RegisterRtpDemuxerSink_w() does a block-invoke we will in practise only ever have a single demuxer update pending at a time.\n\nHowever I think block-invokes are the devil, so I decided to make this code future-proof in case we ever remove that block-invoke.\n\nAlso, I am using an std::map\u003cK,V\u003e instead of an std::queue\u003cV\u003e, even though the id is just an incrementing counter, because I wanted to avoid having to introduce a lock. The map allows me to only access recently_removed_receive_streams_ on the worker thread.",
