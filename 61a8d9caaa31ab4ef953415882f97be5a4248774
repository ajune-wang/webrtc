      "message": "It seems like this change affects bandwidth estimation behavior. Specifically, packets without a packet_id are getting de-duped by this change when they previously were counted multiple times in TransportFeedbackAdapter. So to maintain the same behavior we still need to call TransportFeedbackAdapter with packets with `packet_id \u003d\u003d -1`.\n\nIs it this PostTask we want to avoid: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/call/rtp_transport_controller_send.cc;l\u003d419;drc\u003dc1d62d8428875969cdc66dade8090d8863b2561e ?\n\nIf so, then we could add `last_sent_packet_-\u003epacket_id !\u003d -1` to the check added in this cl.\nOtherwise, we could check if a packet_msg returned from ProcessSentPacket before calling the pacer and let the TransportFeedbackAdapter do the de-duping instead.\n\nIf we think neither of those are a good options, then I think we need to land this behind a field trial (or add a kill-switch) and roll it out in an experiment to make sure we are not affecting clients negatively.",
