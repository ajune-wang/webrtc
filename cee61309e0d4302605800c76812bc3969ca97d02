But I wonder can I also delete receiver_.RemoveAllCodecs(); and  receiver_.FlushBuffers(); as NetEq shouldn\u0027t have packets initially and DecoderDatabase\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/modules/audio_coding/neteq/decoder_database.cc?dr\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d27\nseems to have no decoders on its creation? Because if we can remove them then we can delete entire method from implementation and interface.",
