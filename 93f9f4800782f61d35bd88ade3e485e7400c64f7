      "message": "I like the simplicity of it, not having to list all the layer count and we should probably integrate that in the other fixture.\n\nThough, as it is, it will create a lot of tests (153 in this patch), and that will be a problem to run that in CI. It\u0027ll be even worse when we add all the remaining SVC modes.\nI don\u0027t think there\u0027s a lot of value in testing all the combinations, it\u0027ll be testing the emulated SFU more than the actual codecs.\nAsserting on 0 decoder errors is probably better as it will go through all the frames anyway.\n\nBut the SFU is needed to test the S modes, so it\u0027d be great to have something like that landed, which I started working on this afternoon until Artem remembered your change. For S modes, we probably just want to check a single layer though.",
