      "message": "This should either be included with the other top-level things (even if it\u0027s an empty struct for them) or moved to linux/wayland, and at that point maybe renamed to something like xdg_portal_metadata ?\n\nFurther, it seems to me that if this is going to be a requirement (e.g. can\u0027t be built except with USE_PIPEWIRE), that there may be some check or cast or some level of the CRD code with enough knowledge to extract this directly from e.g. base_capturer_pipewire that doesn\u0027t require modification to the public interface? Or is it because we need to extract it from the desktop_and_cursor_composer?",
