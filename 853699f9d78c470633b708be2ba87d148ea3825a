      "message": "Yes, but in the new patch set, the compiler is the one doing the verifying---it will complain if you\u0027ve forgotten a macro. It\u0027s easy for a human to verify with a glance that we get tracing if RTC_TRACE_EVENTS_ENABLED and that we don\u0027t get tracing if !RTC_TRACE_EVENTS_ENABLED.\n\nIn this old patch set, the human needs to read all those lines and verify that they all do or don\u0027t trace depending on whether RTC_TRACE_EVENTS_ENABLED. I noticed this immediately because I was the one having to do all the reading. :-)",
