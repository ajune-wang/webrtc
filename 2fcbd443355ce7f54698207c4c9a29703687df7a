      "message": "Hmm, yeah, this isn\u0027t super well worded. It\u0027s the ChannelSend.rms_levels_ object that collects up stats on all of the samples fed to Analyze() and does the calculation (and resets the stats) when we call Average(). After the cl, we call Average() to calculate \u0026 reset as soon as a packet is produced and send it along with that packet.\nUpdated the description to reference the rms_levels_ obj, hope that\u0027s clearer.",
