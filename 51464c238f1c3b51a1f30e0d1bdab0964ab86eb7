      "message": "This classification seems somewhat arbitrary. I really don\u0027t want to have even more special cases for screenshare.\n\nIn this case, it is used only for configuration of experiments? I\u0027d prefer if we could at least confine screenshare flags to video-specific code. I think VideoSendStream already has VideoContentType, which could be use to configure ALR, taking experiment flags into account.",

A send stream can tell the congestion controller whether or not the stream thinks it is likely to (temporarily) be application limited. That\u0027s a hint that can be useful to any congestion controller, and the experiment can control whether or not the stream tells the truth.\n\nAnd I think even an interface like \"EnableExperimentX\" (assuming we can delete it when the experiment is over) is preferable over another screencast flag.",
