If it doesn\u0027t, or you are not sure please let me know of some docs on how to build the webrtc targets from within a chromium checkout.\n\nYes, I see them built for example here: https://ci.chromium.org/p/webrtc/builders/try/android_arm_rel/22910?, so we should be fine.\n\n\u003e - I left in the \"custom_package\" template arg even though it is no longer required because I noticed some comments about a Bazel converter, I suspect that it might need that template arg.

When you will deprecate that as well we will have to update the Bazel converter we use for WebRTC.",
