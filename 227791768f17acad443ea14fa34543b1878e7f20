      "message": "\"Say something nice\" it says. I hope this review finds you well. If SCTP is generally simple, this extension (RFC6525) is not designed in the same spirit. \n\nOne can surely understand why a \"Data Channel Close\" operation was implemented like this, instead of having e.g. a DATA_CHANNEL_CLOSE message in RFC8832. For example, this design allows implementations to discard messages, but other than that, it\u0027s quite complicated and puts a lot of work on the SCTP implementation. There should be quite good test coverage, though.",
