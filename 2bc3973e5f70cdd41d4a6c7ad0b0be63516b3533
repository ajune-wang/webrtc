      "message": "This looks like a race. This variable is now written on the worker thread and read on the signalling thread.\n\nIt looks to me like media_channel_  should always only be modified or used on the worker thread. So can you refactor SetmediaChannel to to invoke the worker thread and then set media_channel_ \u003d and do all of that work on the worker thread. You then dont need GenerateKeyFrame or SetEncodedSinksEnabled.\nYou can add thread annotations to saved_encoded_sink_enabled.",
