PrintRdPerf can similarly just be a plain function. That won\u0027t amount to a major difference, but it doesn\u0027t mix the inheritance-based style with the independent fixture style:\n\nTEST(VideoProcessorIntegrationTestLibvpx, HighBitrateVp9) {\n  auto fixture \u003d CreateLibvpxIntegrationTestFixture();\n  \n  fixture-\u003econfig.SetCodecSettings(...);\n  fixture-\u003eProcessFramesAndMaybeVerify(...):\n}",

      "message": "This arguably breaks the law of Demeter, which is unfortunate. This means the test is highly coupled to the config and its place within fixture_. You could put SetCodecSettings into the fixture base class and make it forward to the config\u0027s SetCodecSettings, but that comes with the cost of duplicating the parameter list. There\u0027s also a bunch of other things we want to do with the config, and we can\u0027t create proxy methods for all of those in the fixture. You could also make an accessor that returns a pointer to config which gives you some flexibility, but I doubt that kind of flexibility will help us.\n\nI think it\u0027s OK to keep things as is and keep it simple, at least if the config changes relatively infrequently. It will be painful to rename or remove fields in the config since it will break both tests here and downstream, but it doesn\u0027t help if we layer proxy methods on top of it.",
