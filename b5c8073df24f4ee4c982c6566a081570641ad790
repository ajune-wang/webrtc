      "message": "I wonder if it would be possible to make this simpler. If the only thins feedback adapter cares about is identity, could we assign an integer, increasing by one for each new unique route (as defined here) already where the NetworkRoute is created. That way we can propagate just that number.\n\nThis scales well, since any new criteria for uniqueness will only affect the calculation at one single point.\n\n(I considered doing something similar already when we only cared about local and remote ID, but as we add criteria, I think it becomes even more appealing)",

      "message": "It could work, but it would not be a noop on frequent network toggling A-\u003eB-\u003eA. Currently, data-in-flight from first use of A will be remember on 2nd visit. Whereas with suggested change, at TransportFeedbackAdapter level, the two uses of A would look like completely different routes. But maybe that is ok? In that case, I guess there is no need to store data-in-flight per route, but only one number counted, reset to 0 on a route change?\n\nA bit worried about making this change without any larger scale testing.",

      "message": "My reply assumes that the ID is generated in RtpTransportControllerSend, whereas you say \"where the NetworkRoute is create\" which means above that. I would not recommend putting it above RtpTransportControllerSend as it is the ID that determines how route changes are handled in bandwodth control. That should happen close to the bandwidth control itself.",
