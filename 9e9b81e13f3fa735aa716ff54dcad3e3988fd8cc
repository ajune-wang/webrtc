      "message": "Hi,\n\nas mentioned in https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/189544 (which I abandoned), I decided to pick some PipeWire improvements which are really needed to extend PipeWire support in WebRTC. This doesn\u0027t add any API or change behavior as the previous PR, it just adds support for window sharing and dmabuf support and some code improvements on top of that. This is also code which have been already reviewed many times as part of the previous review.\n\nThank you.\n\nJan",

If possible I\u0027d recommend finding another reviewer right now\n\nHi Tommi,\n\nI understand. However, you are the one who already reviewed this code when it was part of my previous (much bigger) review. This one is only a small portion and focuses only on PipeWire code, it doesn\u0027t change behavior of the capturer at all, it just internally can do more things like window sharing. The same code has been already reviewed and merged in Firefox upstream.\n\n",
