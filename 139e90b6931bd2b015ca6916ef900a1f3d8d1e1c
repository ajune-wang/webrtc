      "message": "I think it would be better with this as a non-inner class responsible for the num_packets counter and method, and holding a pointer to an RtcpPacketParser. Then let the caller pass an RtcpPacketParser to the constructor. So test cases would construct two objects,\n\nRtcpPacketParser parser;\nTransportSomething transport(\u0026parser);\n\nAnd then we don\u0027t need any class inheriting from RtcpPacketParser.\n\nThat way, the changes can be seen as replacing MockTransport with a transport explicitly wired to an RtcpPacketParser.",
