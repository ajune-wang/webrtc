This makes me nervous.\nBaseChannel::SetRtpTransport(nullptr) disconnects from the transport, and is NOT called from BaseChannel\u0027s destructor - if stuff comes into the channel from the network thread between this line and the SetRtpTransport inside the BlockingCall below, will callbacks be called on the deleted object?",

      "message": "The `SetRtpTransport(nullptr)` call which was on line 345, is never made since SetChannel is never called when `channel_` is valid (non-nullptr - see e.g. check on line 319).\n\nWhen looking into ClearChannel I checked this code too including the call sites for each and found that the code that this CL removes, is not a valid case for this method. There\u0027s also an additional check in the channel destructors that require them to be deleted on the worker thread, but `channel_to_delete` always goes out of scope on the signaling thread (another signal that shows that it\u0027s not the way things are architected).",
