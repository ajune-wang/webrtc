      "message": "Having EXPECT_TRUE called in a thread makes the test prone to races, and there\u0027s the risk the test exits before this gets called. I think you\u0027re probably covering this with WaitForCompletion. Not sure here, I think it might be better to keep a list of strings, protected by a mutex, that you retrieve from the test thread later.\n\nWe should also follow the arrange-act-assert rule, i.e.\n\nsetup sctp transport etc\ntest.start()\nassert on stuff\n\nHaving assertions sprinkled throughout the code makes tests brittle and harder to read.",

      "message": "This kind of complexity would be unacceptable in a unit test. Normally my advice here would be to unroll the loop, but having a 16k line test is bad, so let\u0027s go with this. This is wayyyyyy more complex than a test normally should be, but this is more of a load test than a unit test.",
