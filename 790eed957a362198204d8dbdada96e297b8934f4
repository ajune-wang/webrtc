      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should use kStopped here. It is a special state that is reached by executing stopping procedures (other methods), so I don\u0027t want to set it prematurely or surface kStopped in the [[FiredDirection]] or [[CurrentDirection]]. And I really don\u0027t like the idea of current_direction() being kStopped when the boolean stopped() is still false. I don\u0027t know if that causes any problems now, but having contradictory states is never good. And besides, the spec uses \"inactive\" here.\n\nPlease use kInactive.",
