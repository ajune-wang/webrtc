      "message": "Naming is hard. A \"ThresholdWatcher\" sounds like an object whose only purpose is to watch a (likely external) value and trigger a callback, but this also _manages_ the value... \n\n`ThresholdedValue`? Also sounds like a passive object. I\u0027ll go with your suggestion as I can\u0027t come up with anything better right now. It\u0027s an internal class, so it\u0027s easy to change when we come up with a better name.",
