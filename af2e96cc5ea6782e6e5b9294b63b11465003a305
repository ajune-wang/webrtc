Probably you should add some log message in here.\n\nEither way, you should change the comment, because this can only happen if the payload is exactly 1 byte long (the proof is simple: if there are at least 3 packets, we could avoid sending one middle packet and still fit into the capacity, because last and first extensions fit into packet and leave some space thanks to check at L70-71. This leaves 2 packets and 1 byte of payload).",
