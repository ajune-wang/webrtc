      "message": "Was this CL for demonstration purposes or actually up for review?\n\nThe technical side of this is that simple. However, it needs to be added to the spec first to be allowed exposure (https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-stats/issues), or it must be placed behind Origin Trial or C++-only exposure (requires some additional wiring that has not been done before but shouldn\u0027t be difficult).\n\n\"Echo likelihood\" is tricky to standardize without a widely applicable and precise definition of what \"echo likelihood\" means. Our echo detector is an implementation detail. Would the value 0.8 mean the same thing in Chrome as it does in Firefox/Safari/Edge/etc, were they to implement it? This might be something we ship by describing it in the provisional stats spec (it has not been used yet, but the repo is set up: https://github.com/henbos/webrtc-provisional-stats). That would be an acceptable compromises: We intend to standardize and we provide a working definition, but perhaps one not precise enough to meet the W3C standards bar, and one that would need revisiting if the stat proves useful. If on the other hand we do not intend for it to be standardized, then this is a \"goog stat\" not to see the light of day in the new API.\n\nCC hta@ in case this leads to a discussion.",

      "message": "Chromium has two guards against surfacing non-standard stuff:\n1. The filter, ignoring any unrecognized dictionary types. This is not as powerful as checking individual members but better than nothing. I didn\u0027t want to end up doing string comparisons for a hundred members for performance reasons.\n2. The integrationtest with withelist. There is a browsertest performing a call between two tabs and does getStats(), if any stats show up that are not whitelisted the test will fail. This is done on a per-member basis, but this will only catch stats that are surfaced in the test\u0027s scenario.\n\nI think the right approach is to add a new category of stats members:\nRTCExperimentalStatsMember\u003cT\u003e\n\nWith RTCStatsMemberInterface::is_experimental() returning true for those and false for RTCStatsMember\u003cT\u003e.\n\nThe RTCStatsReport iterator could then easily skip or include experimental stats, perhaps a switch report-\u003eExposeExperimentalStats(true);\n\nI proposed this here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/17FyH5Oeslk2fF66AOqwUALnDX1bCPrxI8zU3bJXHA08/edit?usp\u003dsharing\nThe document also discusses how experimental stats might be tied to Origin Trial and specific \"experiments\" in Chrome, but it is not up-to-date, I think we decided to control experimentation differently, to be decided when we actually run an experiment.\n\nIn any case, C++ land should have experimental stats that are not exposed to Chrome by default, and RTCExperimentalStatsMember\u003cT\u003e sounds good to me.
