This code doesn\u0027t handle that case currently. I think the best we can do in that case is to log the error (similar to how it\u0027s done in the default handler, see https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/gfx/x/xlib_support.cc;drc\u003d36c59c53be1d8852f5087008c45a95797bac9730;l\u003d18 ).",
