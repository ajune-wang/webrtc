      "message": "I\u0027m not happy with the change to Stop() - it seems that the \"end track\" argument is a result of multiple uses of the word \"Stop\" - my personal preference would be to align terminology with the JS API and have \"Stop\" always transition to the ended state; the \"Stop(false)\" function (if needed at all) could instead be called \"Pause\". (I don\u0027t like the previous version either, but this seems more confusing).\n\nThe overall changes look good, otherwise. Do we have unit tests (death test?) for what happens when you pass the voice channel to construction and then don\u0027t call either of the Setup*MediaChannel functions? (Never require something that you can\u0027t test for....)",

It happens when the channel is null - that is, we\u0027re discarding the channel, which only makes sense if we\u0027re stopping the transceiver.\n\nDoes this ever happen anywhere where reactivation is possible?\nIf not, does Stop() need an argument?",
