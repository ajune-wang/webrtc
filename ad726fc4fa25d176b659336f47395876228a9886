      "message": "If you\u0027re talking about how towards the end of the test, messages still end up received but after a longer and longer delay, that\u0027s because usrsctp is sending combined SACK+DATA packets that just barely exceed the MTU. When retransmitted, the SACK and DATA chunks are in separate packets, so they get through. But each time this happens, the retransmission timer doubles until it exceeds the test timeout. So in short, this is expected behavior.",
