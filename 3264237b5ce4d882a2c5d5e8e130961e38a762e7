      "message": "Increasing the keyframe size will improve the spatial quality - but there is also a significant risk of adding delay and stuttering on constrained networks. Sacrificing quality for latency is a conscious decision here. Any change of this nature would need to be gated by an experiment so we can verify real-world impact under a variety of conditions.",

      "message": "Agreed with Erik. Bigger frames mean higher delay. By settings optimal buffer size to 1 second you essentially tell encoder that it is OK to accumulate and keep 1s delay which is very high value for real-time apps (600ms, current default, is already quite high value).",

      "message": "`rc_buf_initial_sz` is translated into how many bits of buffer to used for first key frame, it is not necessary to increase the encoding latency [1]. But bigger key frame size could introduce transmit latency, that I will investigate. Overall, the size of hundred of delta frames could be decreased.\n\n[1] vp9_encoder.c - Chromium Code Search\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main:third_party/libvpx/source/libvpx/vp9/encoder/vp9_encoder.c;l\u003d1550;drc\u003d20911ffd8a0e1636801ddf303c17375fdedf9c83;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d1\n\nWhat interests me if that set maximum `rc_buf_initial_sz` has little impact on L1T1, and base layer of L1T3; The improvement comes mostly from higher layer of SVC. The rate controller of SVC is probably not optimal for SVC here.\n\nIt should exists some optimal points that the picture quality/bitrate improves `A-Persents`, with the COST of `B-Persents` longer latency.\n\nAgreed it should be very cautious to change current value. I will do more analysis on the delay and picture quality, then back to this CL.",
