THe scope of `_captureThread` (which is joinable), from the call to `SpawnJoinable()` and until the call to `Finalize()` is inclusive of the scope of the thread. Right?\n\nBtw, the risk of allocating a ref count on the worker thread could also be that unexpectedly teardown might happen on the worker thread and not where Finalize() is called from.",
