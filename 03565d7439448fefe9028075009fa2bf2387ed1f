      "message": "That is opposite of my idea:\nI would like to deprecated spatialLayers together with number_of_spatial_layers and number_of_temporal_layers in favor of single scalability_mode member. (or a scalability_mode per simulcast stream?)\n\nDown the stack I need to convert VideoCodec back to scalability mode name, in particular to support scalability modes that currently can\u0027t be expressed with the VideoCodec struct (e.g. key svc with shift structures). Even KSvc vs FullSVc is not communicated in the spatialLayers (other than with VP9 specific settings)\n\nWhile configuring av1 encoder I know how to configure it using scalability_mode, but configuring it with various members of the VideoCodec is far from trivial.\n\nAs a intermediate solution I can modify SetScalabilityMode to not just set this member, but also to configure spatialLayer and other fields. Would that be better from your point of view?",

      "message": "The reason is that the VideoCodec structure is supposed to be the low level representation of the encoder\u0027s configuration, so the scalability mode should be expanded there.\n\nFor modes that can\u0027t currently be expressed with the current structure, we should just fix that and rework the VideoCodec struct.\n\nI don\u0027t think that having setScalabilityMode populate the spatialLayer struct is a good way to do this, though we need something similar elsewhere. There\u0027s already enough complexity in the codebase that we don\u0027t want 2 ways to populate this member.\n\nYes, it would make the implementation of the SVC spec easier for some part, but general maintenance of the WebRTC library would be more complex because of having 2 different ways to configure encoders (through spatialLayers and through this new member). Who takes precedence and when needs to be properly written and implemented in all codecs first.",
