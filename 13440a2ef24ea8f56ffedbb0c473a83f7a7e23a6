      "message": "Is this a write-only variable?\n\nDoes decrypting media on an unsignalled ssrc make sense? I\u0027m not familiar with how e2e encryption is setup, but I imagine that there\u0027s some signalling exchange to derive the encryption key. Is there any case where we know the keys needed to decrypt the media packets, but not yet know the ssrc?",

      "message": "No we will always have this mapping. My other CL introduces webrtc::CryptoOptions::Frame with a new optional field: crypto_options.frame.require_frame_encryption which will largely solve any issue with unsignaled streams so that is something I hope to integrate into this change once it gets sign off.\n\nThat will let API users force webrtc to drop all incoming packets if a frame decryptor has not been attached. This does raise some more complex issues related to how we deal with those dropped frames when a frame decryptor is eventually attached.",
