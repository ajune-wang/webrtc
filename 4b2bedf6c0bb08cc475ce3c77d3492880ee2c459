      "message": "After talking about this with an msan engineer, it seems that __msan_set_expect_umr is used in the msan test suite in order to speed up things, but it still causes a crash (the exit code 77 means that msan has detected an error), if we want to keep it going and reset __msan_set_expect_umr to 0 we have to compile with -fsanitize-recover\u003dmemory.\n\nWe can achieve the same result using EXPECT_DEATH, so we expect that msan will detect the problem and if it doesn\u0027t, the test will fail.",
