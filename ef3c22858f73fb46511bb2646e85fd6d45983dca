      "message": "Thanks for catching this. I have added a TODO to register the type value of the network information and will work on it soon. To resolve the conflict with the registered ENF-FLOW-DESCRIPTION that takes the value 0xC001, it may take a while for us to deprecate the old value in order to interoperate with old endpoints.\n\nMy understanding is that the STUN-related objects we define in p2p/ are only intended for ICE within WebRTC, and so far it is okay to have conflicts (though not ideal) with IANA values as long as we maintain internal interoperability. Let me know if there are caveats I overlooked.",
