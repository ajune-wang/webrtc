      "message": "A cipher suite is a specific thing in TLS and doesn\u0027t include the signature algorithm. This isn\u0027t a cipher suite. Also, if you do certificates in both directions, there are two signatures and they may negotiate different algorithms, so \"the signature\" is off.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n`// Find out which signature algorithm was used by the peer`\n\nThat\u0027s why this API says peer in it. This is \"which signature algorithm did the peer sign / I verify\" rather than \"which signature algorithm did I sign\". (Don\u0027t think we currently retain that one... Chrome doesn\u0027t need it because we already inject a custom signer and can just histogram there.)",
