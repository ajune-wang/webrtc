It\u0027s not a huge win.\n\nThe reason why I did it was because in a big media server, we initially used an internal CopyOnWrite class, but migrated to using WebRTC\u0027s to better align with it. In that migration, some benchmarks became worse, and I said that I would investigate if I can make WebRTC\u0027s as good as the other class. \n\nWe don\u0027t spend much CPU on this, but I just wanted to see what I could do.
