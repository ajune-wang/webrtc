      "message": "This is a problem, when the call goes to ActionReceiver::OnPacketReceived, which calls back to UnbindReceiver. And deadlocks with a non-reentrant mutex.\n\nOne way to fix this usecase might be to add a return value to OnPacketReceived, and do the unbinding here (without taking the lock again).",

      "message": "Adding return value has the drawback that its an api change, and not really fitting well in EmulatedNetworkReceiverInterface.\n\nSince only use is in CrossTrafficRouteImpl::NetworkDelayedAction, a more local change would be to update the EmulatedEndpointImpl::port_to_receiver_ mapping to include a \"one-shot\" flag, which implies that the binding is removed after first received packet. (Or reimplement the NetworkDelayedAction in some completely different way, without binding any port, but that sounds harder).",
