      "message": "About ownership, there\u0027s been more discussion on ownership of injected objects. I think I suggested raw pointer here...\n\nSince PeerConnection is reference counted, it\u0027s not obvious to the application when it is safe to delete the strategy (same applies to turn_customizer above). So I\u0027m afraid the safe way is to  change this to unique_ptr. Sorry about that. \n\nAnd then there may be additional complications, if RTCConfiguration is expected to be copyable.",
