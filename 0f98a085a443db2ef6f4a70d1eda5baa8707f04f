I could\u0027ve sworn that there was somewhere that took advantage of this and essentially just stored a black frame to copy into the queue when needed but I can\u0027t seem to find that implementation now; so when I\u0027d proposed this I thought there was already some mechanism to do this; but I guess maybe not? So sorry about creating this extra work.",
