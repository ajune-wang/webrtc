      "message": "Is the pair relevant? Say we are interested in our outgoing send stream with ssrc \u003d\u003d 1. If we get an RTCP message with sender_ssrc \u003d\u003d 2 and a report block with source_ssrcs \u003d\u003d 1, then that\u0027s relevant to us and the most recent report block for our ssrc.\n\nIf we next get an RTCP message with sender_ssrc \u003d\u003d 3 and a report block also with source_ssrc \u003d\u003d 1, that\u0027s and update for our stream. The previous report, which happened to use a different sender_ssrc, should now be obsolete and no longer interesting. \n\nAs far as I understand, the sender_ssrc of an RTCP message is mostly irrelevant for a PeerConnection.",

      "message": "The RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats object does actually expose both SSRCs (the remote-inbound-rtp object\u0027s ssrc is the |sender_ssrc| and the localId referencing the outbound-rtp object uses the |source_ssrc|).\n\nYou are right in that once the |sender_ssrc| changes, the old Report Block should no longer be very interesting. I think the spec should say that we delete these remote-inbound-rtp stats objects that are no longer of interest, but the spec explicitly says \"RTP monitored objects are not deleted\":\nhttps://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/#the-rtp-statistics-hierarchy\n\nAs-is, the comment correctly describes the behavior and it leads to a spec-compliant implementation. However, I think there is room for interpretation of the spec and perhaps we want to do something different or update the spec. I filed https://crbug.com/webrtc/10681 for follow-up discussions.",
