      "message": "I think this change is a step in the right direction: the factory is responsible for the media parameters (H.264 profile and level, FlexFEC repair window size, etc.), and somebody else is responsible for the BWE parameters (transport-cc and REMB).\n\nIn the future maybe we could event move out all non-media \"SDP codecs\" from the factory, since the code supporting RED/FEC is not injectable anyway. Just like the RTX codecs are handled somewhere else.",
