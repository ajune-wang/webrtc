It adds RTC_GUARDED_BY, but no new locks, instead RTC_NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS with comments.\n\n\u003eSince we\u0027re in general moving away from using ProcessThread, is there a need to modify the class beyond adding documentation?\n\nThe reason I was touching the class at all is that it\u0027s one of the few remaining users of the deprecated RecursiveCriticalSection. I was thinking thread annotation would help cleaning that up. But if you think it\u0027s overkill, I can change back to a doc-only cl.",
