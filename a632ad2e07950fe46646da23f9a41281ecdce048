Is there any risk that this could cause issues (such as congestion or exhaustion of the RTCP budget)?\nMy guesstimator says \"no\" (20 ms is such a short time that it doesn\u0027t matter, and nacks aren\u0027t needed *that* often anyway in the normal case), but I\u0027d like to have reassurance that you\u0027ve considered it.",
