See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50605/signed-to-unsigned-conversion-in-c-is-it-always-safe\n\n\"cast to Word32\" mentioned in the comment is confusing since Word32 is not used anywhere in the code.\n\nAnd there also seems to be no tests for this logic.\n\nSo plenty of opportunities for further improvement...",
