      "message": "Danil: Thank you for your comment. I respect the code owner\u0027s preference and style. In this CL I only suggested the `const` that helped my investigation of b/265848768.\n\nIt may be possible to reduce the variable scope of the first `info` (declared at line 1344). I added a comment to mark the current end of the variable scope.\n\nIt seems hard to reduce the variable scope of the second `info` (declared at line 1872) because it is used in many places consecutively. So adding `const` to the second `info` is very helpful.",
