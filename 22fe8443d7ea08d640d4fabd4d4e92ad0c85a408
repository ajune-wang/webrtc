      "message": "Even with this case prevented, there are still other things that will cause a crash. For example:\n\nOffer 1 (with max-bundle):\n\na\u003dgroup:BUNDLE audio video data\nm\u003daudio 9\n...\nm\u003dvideo 9\n...\nm\u003dapplication 9\n...\n\nOffer 2:\n\na\u003dgroup:BUNDLE audio video\nm\u003daudio 0\n...\nm\u003dvideo 0\n...\nm\u003dapplication 9\n...\n\nAs soon as \"bundle_group_ \u003d new_bundle_group\" happens, we forget about everything in the previous bundle group, and as a result don\u0027t fire signals for those MIDs. Something needs to be done to more robustly handle a bundle group being changed. At minimum, ensuring that all appropriate callbacks are invoked before destroying a transport.\n\nI have some general ideas how this could be done, so if you need ideas let\u0027s chat.\n\nSome other things I noticed which we should also fix:\n\n* We allow the answer to contain a BUNDLE group that\u0027s not a subset of the offered group. That should be an error.\n* We allow a BUNDLE group to contain a MID that no m\u003d section has, which should also be an error.\n* If an answer removes an m\u003d section from an established BUNDLE group, we create a JsepTransport for it... Only offers should be able to create new transports. An answer shouldn\u0027t be able to remove an m\u003d section from an established group without rejecting it.",
