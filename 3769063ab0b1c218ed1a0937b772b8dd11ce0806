      "message": "For safety, can we split this CL up? The first, uncontroversal one would implement the API but always trigger the keyframes at all the streams.\n\nThe second one would allow per-stream key-frames in some scenarios. It would be easy to revert later.\n\nI\u0027m not having a second thoughts about this whole idea. We also need to be very careful to not break the PLI and FIR processing, since some SFUs might rely on keyframes generated at all streams when they send a key-frame request on any of them.",

      "message": "Ilya, what is your objection to per-stream keyframe requests? Complexity or something else?\nI can see the appeal of not needing to degrade all the streams based on something you have apriori knowledge will be useful on only one of them. I\u0027m not sure why we haven\u0027t moved in this direction for PLI/FIR already, assuming there is legacy baggage there. For a new API there should be no such concerns though?",
