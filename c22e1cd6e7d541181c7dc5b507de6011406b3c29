      "message": "(Didn\u0027t realize this was saved as draft instead of being sent)\n\nOops. Just pushed the updated patchset. Regarding CI testing, this is actually a good question as Linux-capable RISC-V hardware isn\u0027t widely available or performant enough for rapid feedback. The fastest RISC-V SoC available, SiFive FU740, has roughly the same single-core performance as the Cortex A53 (emulation is even worse). Furthermore, Chromium doesn\u0027t build on RISC-V yet.\n\nFor more context, I did this as part of the effort to port NixOS to RISC-V, and the patch was initially submitted to PulseAudio\u0027s downstream fork of WebRTC [1].\n\n[1] https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/webrtc-audio-processing/-/merge_requests/19",
