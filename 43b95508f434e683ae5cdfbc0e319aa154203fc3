Because unsigned arithmetic in C++ is error prone...\n\n(I almost ended up recommending that you switch as much of this CL as possible to signed integers, but there are too many interfaces that use size_t for this to be a clear net win. Personally I would have tried it, but I\u0027ll leave the choice to you. If you do, dchecked_cast is a good tool to consider.)",
