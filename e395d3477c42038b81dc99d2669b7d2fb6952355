      "message": "Hmm, I thought those presubmit warnings are harmless. Anyway, I fixed them, but there is one I\u0027m not sure about.\n\n/home/jgrulich/development/projects/others/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/modules/desktop_capture/linux/xdg_desktop_portal_base.cc:37:  Unary operator\u0026 is dangerous.  Do not use it.  [runtime/operator] [4]\n\nThat\u0027s about the operator\u0026 I use for the Scoped() object to get a pointer to pointer. The only workaround for this might be not using the operator, but use something like:\n\nT** getPointer() { \n   RTC_CHECK(!ptr_);\n   return \u0026ptr_;\n}\n\nThis should be working the same way, however the code readability is much worse as instead of using \"\u0026scoped\" I have to use \"scoped.getPointer()\". Should I go this way?",
