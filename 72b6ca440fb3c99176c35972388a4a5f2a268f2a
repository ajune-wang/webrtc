In terms of build (h/t Mirko) that feels super awkward. If you have suggestions where to put a more centralized packet dumper I\u0027m all ears.\n\nTogether with video_replay such dumps remain super useful though and if we can ship it in Chrome we might even get rid of the beta/canary \"allow unencrypted rtp\" flag.",
