      "message": "I was wondering - this is an objective-c api -- would you rather have a caller do the casting \"(const uint8_t *) [[yuv u] bytes]\"? In objective-c you are unlikely to have a pointer to the const uint8_t to begin with, right? (I might be making some incorrect assumptions here), so this felt like a more natural fit to the objective c interfaces.\n\nCan you give me examples of the consistency? Where do we currently accept (const uint8_t *)?",

This is a pretty thin wrapper around the underlying C++ implementation, and I think this class would be likely to be used from a more low-level context where you\u0027re dealing with C pointers, so I also think accepting uint8_t* makes sense.",
