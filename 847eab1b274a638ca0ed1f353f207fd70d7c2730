      "message": "Yes, that\u0027s a benefit, but I also don\u0027t like mocking things that doesn\u0027t have to be mocked. In this case it becomes a bit extreme since FrameBuffer can\u0027t function correctly without VCMTiming, so it really is a part of the class IMO. Testing each class separately becomes closer to testing implementation details, rather than testing the behavior.\n\nIf you feel strongly about it I could change, but I don\u0027t think I agree. :)",
