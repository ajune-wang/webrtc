I ended up scratching my head when someone told me DD does not work for VP8 while it works for all other codecs.\n\nTurned out my simulcast playground did not negotiate extmap-allow-mixed. This limits the size of the header extensions and VP8 stands out (not sure why?)\nThen I traced it down to the 2021 change (see issue #) you did and found that I should have remembered that issue...\n\n:-)",
