      "message": "Tight latency bounds may have a negative effect on quality (resulting in more time stretching and underruns). Existing users of the playoutDelayHint API may use it to increase quality (at the cost of latency). This change breaks what we originally intended with the spec.\n\nI think it would be more appropriate to have another API, for example where it\u0027s possible to set both the min and max delay, for this use case where a fixed delay is more important than quality.",
