A requirement for this to work correctly is that the tie breaker is the same for all candidates.\nShould this be documented in the API?\n\nIt\u0027s also not clear from the RFC references that the tiebreaker needs to be included here; it just adds randomness, which may be a good thing, in which case the argument shouldn\u0027t be called tiebreaker, but random_pc_id or something like that, since the fact that the tiebreaker is used is irrelevant to its usage.",
