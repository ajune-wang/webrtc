      "message": "I think it may worth to try to reset the codec only if sw fallback is not available - for H.264 case as the last resource to keep the call. For vp8 we can immediately fallback to sw in this case without reset attempt. Otherwise we may never recover from the case when decoder can always be successfully reopened, but always fails to decode the first frame. For this case we could at least recover by immediate sw fallback for vp8 codec.\n\nOr alternatively add a limitation on the amount of reset attempts - 2 or 3 - similar to encoder",
