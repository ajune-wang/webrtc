      "message": "I think it is better to add interruption stats in NetEqLifetimeStatistics. Yes, we want to make the use of the convenience of rtc::SampleCounter, and we can still use it internally, but we may not need to expose a raw rtc::SampleCounter. It will anyway need to be aggregated to a plain data type at some point. It is better that such aggregation happen in NetEq, so that upper layers do only piping.",
