      "message": "I am wondering if we can have something like \"test/pc/e2e/api/internal\" and move frameworks\u0027 internal details there (this is a pattern followed by absl as well, see https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/abseil-cpp/absl/strings/internal/str_format/bind.h and what they say about it here: https://abseil.io/about/compatibility).\n\nIn that case, we can #include these internal only types here and avoid the forward declaration.\n\nIf we like this option (and I guess it gives us more flexibility because we can define boundaries without worrying to much about transitive includes) I would also suggest we provide PeerArgs\u0027 implementation in the API instead of hiding it. At the end of the day, we only care that users pass std::unique_ptr\u003cPeerArgs\u003e into Run (e.g. do we really need the CreatePeerConnectionE2EQualityTestFixturePeerArgs indirection?)",
