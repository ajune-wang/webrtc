I\u0027ve tried to just silence the warning with a // no-presubmit-check TODO(webrtc:8982), but haven\u0027t found a good place (the obvious places results in very long lines. Maybe we should add a ReadFile utility in test/testsupport/file_utils.cc? \n\nAccording to stack overflow, the current code seems to be the most reasonable and idiomatic way to do it in C++, although it\u0027s \"surprisingly inefficient\" and the extra parentheses are needed to avoid the \"most vexing parse\", see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2602013/read-whole-ascii-file-into-c-stdstring. Lovely language, C++ ;-)",
