      "message": "This is really just affecting a test harness.\nWe should have a REALLY OBNOXIOUS comment in the code saying that this is standards-breaking behavior and that we\u0027re only testing it because there\u0027s historical usage that depends on this working. Once the comment is added, I think this change makes the code more readable, which is good for a test harness.\n",
