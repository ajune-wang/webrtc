The API currently supports the usage (and indeed the PipeWire code currently uses it the way) that I am now documenting.\n\nI probably could also have just added the comment that GetSourceList will always return a source list of length one if using a delegated source list (as documentation for allowing auto-selection) and left off the additional comment on SelectSource, since it already supports telling you if you\u0027ve selecting an Invalid source.",
