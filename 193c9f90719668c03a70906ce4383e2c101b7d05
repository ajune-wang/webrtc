      "message": "How about describing what a proxy is, and say what the difference is between invoking its methods on the signaling thread vs any other thread? Being able to do something synchronously on the signaling thread is invaluable when surfacing state information to chromium and not wanting this unpredictable behavior.\n\nI don\u0027t think this description makes it clear that even the methods that look like they\u0027re synchronous aren\u0027t due to the PROXY behavior. Reading this description it sounds like it is only talking about methods that take callbacks.",
