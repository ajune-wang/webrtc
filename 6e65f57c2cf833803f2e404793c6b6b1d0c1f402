      "message": "I think it would be better to have this be a wrapper of the native rtc::RTCCertificate. That way we could add more of the underlying methods later if they were deemed useful.\n\nSo have a new @interface RTCCertificatePEM which has the private_key and certificate as PEM strings (like the class you have now) then introduce RTCCertificate as an interface which wraps an rtc::RTCCertificate. Check out RTCRtpParameters for an example of how that would look.\n\nFor now, the RTCCertificate can just have a static method for creating from an RTCCertificatePEM and a method for exporting to an RTCCertificatePEM (no need to export the other native methods until someone actually needs them).\n\nAlso, please move this to its own header file.",
