That might be one reason to do something that can be completely enclosed in a DCHECK statement (so that it doesn\u0027t execute this iteration twice in production).\n\nThen again, we expect the list to be very short, so it\u0027s probably a minor issue.",

Iterating through the list up to 3-4 elements is oftentimes faster than a hashset lookup (and you probably wouldn\u0027t say if this was a hashset!) and we probably won\u0027t have more than 2-3 elements in the media transport settings, and certainly not hundreds.",
