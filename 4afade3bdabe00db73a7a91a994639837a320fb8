      "message": "And +Sergey do you have an opinion here? The TL;DR: is that for \"nice\" factors like 2 and 4 there is not much of a performance difference between bilinear and box, but for other factors (e.g. if CPU adaptation is active) the box filter can cost us 1.0% CPU and from the attached pictures I can\u0027t even tell the difference.",

      "message": "There is aliasing with bilinear - https://screenshot.googleplex.com/955aBrXAjLRf5nU. Box is more smooth be definition. Box results in lower encoded QP than bilinear which for QP-based resolution adaptation means higher resolution. I would also check b/152837511 (but not sure if that was caused by bilinear).\n\nIn any case, I think we should make such a change via an A/B experiment.",
