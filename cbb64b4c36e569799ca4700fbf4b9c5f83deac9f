Note that the test may have arbitrary length, even during perf tests.\n\nHaving 10 freezes during 50 second test is not worse than 9 freezes during 45 second test.\n\ne.g. total_freezes_duration \u003d\u003e mean_freeze_duration or freezed_time_percentage. Divide them either by number of freezes/pauses/frames or by the call length.",
