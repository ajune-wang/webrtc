If so, shouldn\u0027t they be called the same thing?\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t see any setting of these flags based on the x-google-flag:conference, but that might be some unchanged logic that I\u0027m not seeing.\n\nThe tests modified seem to set these flags explicitly; is there a test that checks that x-google-flag:conference turns on the new flags?\n",
