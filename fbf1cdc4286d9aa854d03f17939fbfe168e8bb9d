      "message": "Prefer a name relating to the actions of this class. Maybe SetEnableTransmit or just EnableTransmit?\n\nHaving separate Enable/Disable methods might be clearer than a bool argument (the meaning of true is not obvious), similar to other Start/Stop methods. Depends a bit on how it\u0027s used, though; if the typical caller has a bool, it might be inconvenient to dispatch to separate methods. The underlying RtcpTransceiverImpl could still have a single method with bool argument regardless, if that\u0027s convenient.",
