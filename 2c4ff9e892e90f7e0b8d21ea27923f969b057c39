Anyway, I\u0027m also open to changing it to kH265CodecName.\n\nHowever, since these constants may be used to create and/or check against SDP strings, should the constant\u0027s name indicate if it\u0027s an official Media Type Definition? For AVC we have the official \"H264\", but for HEVC we instead have \"H265X\" to indicate that we don\u0027t use the standard RTP packetization format.\n\nOr maybe I\u0027m mistaken? I just saw that PayloadStringToCodecType() uses its own private constants to map a string into a VideoCodecType.",
