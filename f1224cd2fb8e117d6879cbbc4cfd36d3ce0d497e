      "message": "Thank you! To elaborate a bit on the change, the field trial WebRTC-UseActiveIceController was used to launch a refactor of P2PTransportChannel. These tests were parameterized to inject the field trial and test both pre- and post-refactor code paths.\n\nThe refactor is now fully launched, and the field trial is no longer read (https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/294281). So this change cleans up the tests.",
