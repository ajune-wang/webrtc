The comment in rtp_transceiver.h claims it is safe because it\u0027s only done in blocking invokes; are we sure of that?\n\nI remember being particularly frazzled about this when I touched this code in 2022. If we can do it more simply, I\u0027m all for it.",

      "message": "Indeed this is tricky and thanks for raising this. Here\u0027s how I\u0027m thinking about this:\n\n* `thread_` is the signaling thread (S)\n* `channel_` is accessed from S and the network thread (N).\n* (actually, also the Worker thread)\n* When accessed/modified from N, it is always within an invoke from S\n* (same applies to when it\u0027s used from W)\n* `channel_to_delete` is cleared on S. See also `SetChannel()`.\n\nSo, generally I consider `channel_` to belong to S and therefore this should be safe. Touching the channel object on threads other than S must always be done within an Invoke().\n\nDoes that match with your understanding?",
