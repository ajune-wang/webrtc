      "message": "Hi,\n\ntrying to convert more NetEq tests, it turns out this isn\u0027t entirely true.\n\nThe method NetEqImpl::DecodeCng, used in the test NetEqImplTest.CodecInternalCng, calls decoder-\u003eDecode() directly. If this code is still relevant, it seems the proxy object needs to forward calls to DecodeInternal (the test fails in the RTC_NOTREACHED) there. And to do that, DecodeInternal probably needs to be public, not protected. Alternatively, Decode could be made virtual, and forwarded instead.",
