      "message": "Ah, it looks like when Mirko edited the commit message, it discounted his +1 so we didn\u0027t have a sufficient breadth of OWNERS approving. I thought Mirko also owned the DesktopCapture stuff, but I guess not as the OWNERS requirement still isn\u0027t satisfied when I edited it.  You\u0027ll need to edit the commit description (just add a space between bug: and chromium:), and then I can hit CQ+2 for you\n\n@Mirko, are you aware of if this behavior is intended? (editting the commit description counts you as the uploader and thus your CR+1 is now counted as a \"self\" +1 and discounted, but since you aren\u0027t the OWNER your OWNERSHIP doesn\u0027t count either?)",
