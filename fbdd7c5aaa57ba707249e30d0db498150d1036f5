Suggestion:\n\n  // We need release memory order because after the atomic op, the current thread is no longer allowed to touch the refcounted object, so all memory accesses to it must finish before that. We also need acquire memory order because in case we are the ones removing the last reference, we\u0027ll be destroying the refcounted object, and memory accesses related to that must not be reordered before the atomic op.\n  // In short, we release the permission to use the refcounted object, and conditionally acquire the permission to destroy it.",
