      "message": "I will keep this as WIP because this is still not supported in xdg-desktop-portal and the API can change. See https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pull/939.\n\nI moved ScreenCapturePortalInterface into modules/portal as I needed access to it from xdg_desktop_portal_utils and I also think it makes more sense there. I\u0027m just not happy with the way I pass the description as the only way I can add additional parameters is to basically access the base portal class. Adding yet another parameter to StartSessionRequest() is a no-go as it would break for other consumers and this was the only way. It also allows for additional options in the future (if there are any).",

I will try to implement this version.",
