      "message": "Hi, do you think it\u0027s reasonable to delete this method? As far as I\u0027ve found, only use is in tests for SetOption. If you like the change, we\u0027d need to leave a default dummy implementation on the interface, and update downstream subclasses in a few places, before deleting it completely.",
