      "message": "You are correct; that should do it. See https://paste.googleplex.com/5626155309727744. I started out by using only `sleep_count` and that is not sufficient. Did `2*sleep_count` and that was OK. Recall that I found one case where it was not and added `+ 1` and then forgot that I could probably skip the times two or decided to keep it to be extra safe. As is, we *might* still get some initial `kFrameDropped`. Let\u0027s monitor the stats and see. If so, adding a factor or 2 here should be the first thing to try as a fix.",
