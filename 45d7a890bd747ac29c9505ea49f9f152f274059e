      "message": "Yes. In fact, the typing detection .cc and .h files are _completely_ independent of the rest of WebRTC. They depend on nothing except rtc_base export.h, and are not used in APM. Typing detection is run by Chromium code, after APM, in the audio processors there.\n\nI would make it a separate target, but there is some dependency stuff for Chromium+WebRTC that I must read up on first.",
