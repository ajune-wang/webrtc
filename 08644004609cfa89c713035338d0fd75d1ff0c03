You can only send what is negotiated, and you can only respond with what was offered, so what the list contains matters for both sending and receiving.\n\nWe need to support both the send-only and recv-only use cases and what the W3C setCodecPreferences() decides to do could be subtly different from the JSEP setCodecPreferences().",

      "message": "Not asking for a review yet but please bear with me :-)\n\nPS1 just removed the whole send codecs from setCodecPreferences. This works ok in the browser but the unit tests fail.\nAs PS2 shows they are written to expect a scalabilityMode which is not present on recv codecs (on purpose).\nPS3 is the minimal way to remove setCodecPreferences from the receiver where it does not belong according to JSEP. This fixes most of the tests but makes some other tests fail.\nMostly these tests look fixable, they might need some rewriting in order to set the codec preferences on the receiver.\n\nDoes this look like it is going in the right direction?",
