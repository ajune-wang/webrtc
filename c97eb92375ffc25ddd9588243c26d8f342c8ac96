It\u0027s sconn_addr you\u0027re thinking of, which we were using precisely because this callback (and send_cb) didn\u0027t provide ulp_info directly, so we had to get it from the socket address instead.\n\nNote that we\u0027re already casting directly from ulp_info to SctpTransport in the receive callback here: \nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/webrtc/media/sctp/sctp_transport.cc;l\u003d396;drc\u003dbb733b33b305d7bb1eb4b6553e470cc3afc5bf51;bpv\u003d0;bpt\u003d1?q\u003dsctp_transport.cc\u0026ss\u003dchromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc\n\nI went ahead and added the checks anyway, let me know if you want me to undo them.",
