      "message": "that assumes you have a channel. The conservative estimate would be to assume assume a send indication which is length-of-xor(?)-peer-address plus two bytes for the port plus a byte for the family? OTOH SCTP packets should only be sent after a valid pair is established which is when chrome create a turn channeldata binding so this might be fine 99.9999999% of the time.\n\nIdeally this would update for the actual overhead similar to how AudioEncoderOpusImpl::OnReceivedOverhead  works. But that is probably overkill",
