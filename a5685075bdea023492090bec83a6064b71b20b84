This should be the version approved by Mark as we were basically not allowed any UI changes on Chromium side and the only minor change we did was slight modification of the \"Window tab\" in the preview dialog to behave like \"Screen tab\".",

I\u0027m still struggling a little to understand the specifics of the XDG interaction, since I originally misunderstood which picker we plan to show, I think.\n\nWhat is the specific mechanism by which we suppress the XDG picker?\n\nThanks,\n\nWez\n",
