      "message": "I guess technically this may introduce a regression until the corresponding chromium change lands (or if it gets reverted) that the user would only be able to share screens but not windows. I think the change is simple enough that there\u0027s not much risk of that and I can coordinate them to land within a couple of hours of each other; but if you\u0027d prefer I leave this alone and only change it after the Chromium change lands I can do that as well.",
