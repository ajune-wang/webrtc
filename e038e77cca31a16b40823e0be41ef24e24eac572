      "message": "Not for this CL, but I wonder if it\u0027s possible to unit-test this using the VirtualSocketServer.\n\nFor instance, set up a Datachannel and dial the virtual socket server to {5 ms, 200 ms, 1000 ms} delay, and verify that goodput (data received / data sent) is acceptable.\n\nIf we have a few test cases for the corner cases where we think things can go bad, we should have a lot more confidence when tweaking these constants that we\u0027re not breaking other scenarios too badly.\n",
