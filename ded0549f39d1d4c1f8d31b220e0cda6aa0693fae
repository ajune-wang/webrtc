I suggest you change the tests from `TEST_F` to `TEST` and declare the resolution limits vector as local temporary instead.\n\nSince we\u0027re just testing the logic of the `GetSinglecastBitrateLimitForResolutionWhenQpIsUntrusted` method (and the integration thereof) I don\u0027t think you need to replicate the full vector of resolutions - just add say two entries that exercises the code path we\u0027re interested in.",
