I found [1] and assumed that this implementation was the \"latest and greatest\" and simply followed the style to return the frame instead. \n\nNot clear what you mean by returning a union.

In the current code, you actually compare Frames 1 and 2 again before sending the frame up to the page, so you send the full damage region both times.\nC -\u003e The page hasn\u0027t queried for a frame since the frame changed; so in your scenario you\u0027d see that the frames were identical and not send up a damage region. By computing *and not clearing* in ProcessFrame, you track the DamageRegions that the page needs to be made aware of (which in this case is fine to just set to the whole frame).",
