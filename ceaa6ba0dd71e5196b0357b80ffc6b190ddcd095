Please move to the SVC test file if it doesn\u0027t cover an existing use case.\nNote that we do have tests that are more advanced checking that we have frames flowing on *all* the layers requested in the `svc_tests` binary and this is probably redundant.",

      "message": "Let me do any moving in a separate CL. I want an integration test suite that does all of this for both simulcast and SVC so I think it\u0027s a matter of rename and move but that is better suited as a standalone CL.\n\nCurrently these tests use helpers that are used by both unit tests and integration tests",
