      "message": "There is an issue here where ARDAppClient calls `[self disconnect]` when it\u0027s being deallocated, and that sets the state. In general objects shouldn\u0027t message themselves much in dealloc as it causes problems like this. I think we should just get rid of the disconnect message in the dealloc method. Could you try that and see if everything is still fine?",
