      "message": "Right; the reason I originally introduced this class was for RemoveTrack. We were originally just storing pointers to the inner/\"internal\" object, but for RemoveTrack, the caller passes in a pointer to a proxy object it got, which needs to be matched with an inner object. So I wanted a class that gave me both without having to \"static_cast.\" Maybe in this case static_casting would have been the lesser of two evils...\n\nBut anyway, the stats collector doesn\u0027t need to do that. And using the proxy pointers has a potential disadvantage; it would be easy to introduce an extra thread hop without realizing, by calling a method from the \"wrong\" thread. If doing this with the internal object, a DCHECK would be hit, forcing it to be called from the appropriate \"ProducePartialResultsOnFooThread\".",
