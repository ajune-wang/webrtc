To ignore valid mids (i.e, assuming mids are negotiated, and appearing in packets on the wire, but you nevertheless want to ignore them), I think it should work fine to just delete the mid association in the RtpHeaderExtensionsMap that is used when parsing the packets.\n\nWe shouldn\u0027t add a configuration flag \"please don\u0027t do the right thing\" without a pretty good reason.",
