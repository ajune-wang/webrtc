      "message": "Can you add a couple of tests specifically for the behaviors of OnDroppedFrames, that asserts as little as possible about other behaviors, and that nails the edge cases? I prefer behavioral-driven tests to tests that asserts multiple outcomes/behaviors of a single use case.\n\nTests that would be good for the added code:\n- When a single frame is dropped (basically what you\u0027re doing above but in a separate test).\n- When multiple frames are dropped simultaneously and the callback has a value greater than 1 as argument.\n- When frames are dropped because of ClearFramesAndHistory",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think it hurts to have a test that does essentially the same thing. The risk with testing this behavior in a seemingly unrelated test is that if that test is modified or removed, you don\u0027t realize that we lost test coverage for this other behavior. I think repeating some code in a test file is OK. Alternatively, if you have a separate test for the dropping a single frame case, you can remove the assertion in DropTemporalLayerSlowDecoder so that that test doesn\u0027t do multiple things like it does now.\n\nThat\u0027s my suggestion, but I leave this up to you. LGTM.",
