      "message": "Audio folks, can you help with the unit test?\n\nThe failure is caused by neteq not knowing what codec is going to be used until it decodes the first packet, see https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/268144 for a lengthy description of the same issue.\n\nIt works in practice (unless getStats is called before the first packet is decoded) and would be nice to have (even though this is a much smaller problem for audio than for video, at least in some systems)",

Turned out to be some missing calls to SetAudioReceiveStreamStats in addition to a wrong payload type.\n\nNot sure those are entirely correct since for the case of multiple streams the received ssrc is not the one reported in the (fake) stats but that is by design.",
