No need to wait twice (and as a side benefit, you get to test that they do happen at the same time).\n\nThe pattern is repeated multiple times in this file.",

The different states fire different signals so they can sometimes go out of sync for brief moments. \n\nThese particular WAITs didn\u0027t seem necessary when I ran the test locally, and the trybots haven\u0027t run into any problems (yet).",
