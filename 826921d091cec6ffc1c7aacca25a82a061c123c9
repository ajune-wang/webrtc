My expectation was basically what Nisse proposed a long time ago where we burst packets onto the wire as soon as they are dumped into the pacer (up to a certain limit ofc).\n\nAFAICT this would cause additional SendBurstInterval of e2e delay when encode rate ~\u003d pacing rate.\n \nAlso, how would these bursts be used to infer the bandwidth?",
