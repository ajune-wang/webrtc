      "message": "I don\u0027t really see why this class needs to create two MockEchoControl instances if only the second is needed. Could you please explain a bit further.\n\nFurthermore, I agree with the comment from Karl that if only two instances are used herein it is better to use two separate variables rather than an array. I think the code would be shorter and more readable as  Create() would not give the impression that any number of mocks can be created.",
