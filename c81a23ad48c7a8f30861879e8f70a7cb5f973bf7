When this is built in chromium and there are multiple monitors connected, what would the chromium picker show, a combined desktop as X11 does or multiple screens that user can select from? Here it sounds like xdg-desktop-portal has its own picker? Please help to explain a bit in details.",

You can see it on https://tpopela.fedorapeople.org/webrtc_portals.webm . The only downside right now is that the dialog is shown twice. First time for the preview and the second time for the screen cast itself.",
