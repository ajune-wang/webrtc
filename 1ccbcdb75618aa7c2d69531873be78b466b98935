Did you compare with how it works on the AudioRecord side (DEFAULT_AUDIO_SOURCE \u003d AudioSource.VOICE_COMMUNICATION)?\n\nThe idea is that existing clients shall NOT be affected AT ALL by this change and I am not convinced that this is the case.\n\nWhere did you get AudioAttributes.CONTENT_TYPE_SPEECH from in the default case? How do you know that this is used today? Should you even use a builder for the old case?",
