      "message": "I think this is the wrong approach for a few reasons:\n - Simulcast is not a receive side concept, it should be handled by the SFM\n\n - Reordering, lets say we have (10,KF), (11,DF), (5,KF) and (6,DF), what if we receive 10 11, 6, 5 in that order. In that case we would throw away 6 before we had a chance to reset at 5.  \n\n - From https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-rtp-spec/#a83-semantics: frame_number: is represented using 16 bits and increases strictly monotonically in decode order. frame_number MAY start on a random number, and MUST wrap after reaching the maximum value. All packets of the same frame MUST have the same frame_number value.",
