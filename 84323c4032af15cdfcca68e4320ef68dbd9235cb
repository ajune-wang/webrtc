      "message": "What\u0027s the benefit of getting this information via PeerConnectionSdpMethods as opposed to having call_ptr, media_config, etc part of the CreateChannel() method arguments? So far the interface does not justify itself, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more to come.\n\nIf there will be a lot more interaction between RtpTransceiver and pc_ to come in follow-up CLs that RtpTransceiver will need to know about the most things pc going forward, then should we make pc_ be a member variable instead of an argument?",
