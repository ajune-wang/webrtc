      "message": "I would like us to avoid implicitly creating TransceiverStableState objects, either by DCHECKing that they exists or explicitly initializing all members. It seems error-prone to implicitly have a state, with risk of rolling back to some unknown state.\n\nFor example, could this accidentally store a transceiver state with mid null on a transceiver that already has a mid from a previous O/A exchange? Then rolling back un-assigns a mid that was already fully assigned.\n\nIf we are relying on certain assumptions that make this safe I would like them DCHECKed or explained.\n\nBut see my other comments, we may want to go with your earlier patch set.",
