      "message": "Adding rtc_event_log.h here is not a good idea: the .h is paired with rtc_event_log.cc, and pulling a .h away from its .cc is confusing. You\u0027re really tricking anybody depending on this target that they can use RtcEventLog and RtcEvent etc, but if they depend on this target and not rtc_event_log_api, they will get link errors!\n\nI assume you want to do this because you want to avoid circular dependencies. All you\u0027re doing is masking them though; this will be massively annoying for future maintainers to avoid this dastardly trap.\n\nice_log should obviously depend on rtc_event_log_api here. What circular dependencies are you getting? I suspect the problem is that rtc_event_log_api is too big here and that the things ice_log needs from it should be split out into a separate target.",
