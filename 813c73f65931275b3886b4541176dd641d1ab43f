      "message": "It seems like the test runner considers expected failures as failures. Because the log says:\n\u003e [06:43:54:INFO] RTCCameraVideoCapturerTests.mm:252: Expected failure in -[RTCCameraVideoCapturerTests testRotationCameraBackLandscapeLeft]: ((expectedFrame.rotation) equal to (RTCVideoRotation_0)) failed: (\"90\") is not equal to (\"0\")Reason: (Setting orientation on UIDevice is not supported)\n\u003e [06:43:54:INFO] Test Case \u0027-[RTCCameraVideoCapturerTests testRotationCameraBackLandscapeLeft]\u0027 passed (1.014 seconds).\n\nSo it \"passed\" and yet the test case is considered failed.\n\nThoughts on the best way forward?",
