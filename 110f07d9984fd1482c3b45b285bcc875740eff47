Assuming we need to keep them unchanged for backwards-compatibility, I think the previous code made it clearer why these particular values are used, although you can use a comment if you prefer to make the relationship clearer between the simple numeric values and these legacy ones.",

And yes, I preserved them for backwards-compatibility, although the only usage I could find was of the kUnknown value in Chromium, so I am not sure how much value there is in doing so. I\u0027m just erring on the side of caution. But I do like your suggestion of keeping the old code to document why these values are what they are, I\u0027ll do that.",
