Next, someone might just change the parameters in the one of the two places.\n\nThen, we now have two different configs for different scenarios. Why not increase the timeout for all tests?\n\nI would expect this CL to be a 1 line change of a const value somewhere.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/test/pc/e2e/peer_connection_quality_test.cc;l\u003d157;drc\u003d74e6f5b10c176e517d8535b6278e43988df17455",
