      "message": "This is yet another attempt to land this. The previus one failed on:\n1) Unexpected new dependency libepoxy.so.0()(64bit) on distro Fedora [31/32/33] caused by binary chrome\n2) Dependency libepoxy0 (\u003e\u003d 1.0) not satisfiable on distro Debian 10 (Buster) caused by binary chrome\nDependency libdrm2 (\u003e\u003d 2.4.75) not satisfiable on distro Debian 8 (Jessie) caused by binary chrome\n\nThe libepoxy library is used for handlig OpenGL function pointers so I don\u0027t have to dlopen() libGL myself and cast all functions myself. Since it\u0027s better to reduce dependencies, I decided to use glad library instead. This one works the same way, but you can use their website to generate the code to be bundled with your application. I generated code I need for DMA-BUF support and bundled the code here. The generator can be found here [1] and there are projects which already bundle glad library same way I do, for example OBS studio or some 3rd party libraries in Chromium do the same too.\n\nRegarding the libdrm library, I now use dlopen to load it as there is no way how it can be dropped completely.\n\n[1] - https://glad.dav1d.de/\n",

      "message": "Thanks, while it is good to avoid dependencies, I am not sure it is a good idea to include code generated from a website (which license does this code generator use?).\n\nIsn\u0027t is possible to just write the code that is needed to dlopen libGL (I might be underestimating the amount of work here). Other reviewers, what is your opinion on this?",
