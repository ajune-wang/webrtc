(I\u0027ve made classes in the past with crashes in their constructor ... even the simplest test would catch that...)",

      "message": "Do you really want to have all those setters?\nYou will want to limit the amount of permitted complexity caused by modification - the lowest possible complexity is to have everything initialized at construction time and no way to change it; second lowest is \"set only if unset\" (appropriate for a builder pattern, but perhaps not for a factory). Full changeability at any subsequent time is a means of causing bugs that are hard to debug.",
