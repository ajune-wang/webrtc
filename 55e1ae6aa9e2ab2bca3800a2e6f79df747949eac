By that I mean:\n1) scoped_glib stuff\n2) constants\n3) functions you plan to split away in one of your following changes\n\nAll these are related to xdg-desktop-portal, they will most likely not be used anywhere else so we can make something like xdg_desktop_portal_utils.[h,cc] or just portal_utils.[h,cc]. I\u0027m for example working on screencast_stream_utils.[h,cc] so I can re-use some stuff for testing.",
