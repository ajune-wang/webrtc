      "message": "Correct. It\u0027s possible that keeping the low limit would further reduce deceleration (note that the overall change is a very big improvement). I removed it to simplify things, it doesn\u0027t make as much sense conceptually anymore since we increase the high limit instead, but I can run a few more tests to see if it is worth keeping.",
