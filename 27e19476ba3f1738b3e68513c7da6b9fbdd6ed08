Thanks!\n\nHi, yes //build/ is pulled from Chromium (WebRTC reuse build configs and toolchains from Chromium) and that happens here https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/DEPS;l\u003d24;drc\u003dd937f50e20906a3302e41d0201ef6464f2fcc655.\n\nSo, the best thing to do is to create a Chromium CL with this patch.",
