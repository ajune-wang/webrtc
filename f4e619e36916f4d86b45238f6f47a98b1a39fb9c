The additional CLs are changes introduced to address part of your comments, so no new feature. It also helped me to find a bug due to which the default behavior was changing (now fixed). So, could you take a look at the diff between head and the last patchset instead of comparing to the last patchset with comments from you?\n\nCheers,\nAlessio",
