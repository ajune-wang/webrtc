      "message": "I don\u0027t quite understand why this could affect this test?\n\nThe only explanation is that the run was shut off after a layer is encoded but before the decoder sees it, because the `EXPECT_THAT` on line 348 passes, but no the one on line 353.\n\nAnother question is why only `_DD` test fails? What does it mean when using dependency descriptor?",

      "message": "Yes it was dropping a lot of frames, because the bitrate was low (actually 0 in first SL1) and buffer needed time to stabilize. Although even when it did stabilize there were plenty of encoded enhancement frames (TL1, TL2) for SL1, so not sure why decoder did not receive them, it only did when test run went longer to 7 or 8 sec (i choose 10 just to be safe).\n\nHowever, now with the latest webrtc checkout, it seems that the test passes fine as is. It seems that the svc configuration (bitrate and QP per layer) has changed and now much fewer dropped frames. Do you know if anything changed in the webrtc code regarding this test?",
