      "message": "This pattern (pointer to a moved object) is not a good thing. It is hard to read and leads to dangling pointers (as remarked below).\n\nI\u0027d rather have TryAddStats return a pointer when successful (\"your moved value is now here, and this is a non-owning pointer to it\").\n\nOr even move the CreateRemoteOutboundAudioStreamStats into a lambda called from TryAddStats - from the code, it is not at all clear where TryAddStats moves its argument to.",
