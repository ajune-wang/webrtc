      "message": "Agree that this is a bit \"why not\", but unless we think performance gains are to be had here, I\u0027d prefer not to add more conditions since call_-\u003eGetStats() could in theory report call-wide metrics not related to number of RTP streams - less edge cases to test for future CLs. Just my preference though... Do you feel strongly otherwise?",

Any call-wide metrics are wrong in there, see the RTT comment by Stefan.\n\nThis may be a tiny optimization but it is easy to understand (and revert) and receiving many videos is a common use-case.\n\nI wish we had a benchmark ;-)",
