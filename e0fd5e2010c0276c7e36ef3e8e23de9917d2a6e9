I think quite some lines of test code needs to be added. Can be matter of taste of course. Problem is that these snapshots are taken in different places and on different conditions when something is about to change in the state. At the same time the presence of snapshot indicates need for a rollback. The merged snapshot opens possibility that something gets overwritten/discarded by accident.
