      "message": "Hi Kari, thanks for the quick review!\n\nIn the previous code _rotation is not set for face-up, face-down or unknown: https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/+/refs/heads/main/sdk/objc/components/capturer/RTCCameraVideoCapturer.m#275\n\nSo I chose to ignore them and not set _orientation, thus taking the previous value. When you go from landscape to face-up for example, it\u0027s not possible to know (AFAICT) if 0 or 180 rotation should be used, so by ignoring it we use the previous value, which will work for the cases when you are in a given orientation, and then lay the device down.\n\nDoes that make sense? Happy to amend the commit messaage if necessary.",

      "message": "Hey, sorry for the delay in getting back to you. From my understanding of the existing code, `_rotation` should anyway have taken the previous value when _orientation was set to FaceUp or FaceDown by ending up in the `break` from the `switch` on line 262.\n\nMaybe a test case could help illustrate the issue and the effect of this change.",
