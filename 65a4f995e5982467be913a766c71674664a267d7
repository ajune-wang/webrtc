      "message": "A few tests made assumptions that broke with this change, most trivially fixed.\n\nVideoSendStreamTest.SuspendBelowMinBitrate however seems to have been fundamentally pretty broken:\nThe new small first packet seem to cause an RTCP ReceiverReport to be generated slightly earlier,\nthis in turn causes the SendSideBandwidthEstimation::IsInStartPhase() to return false slightly\nearlier, and this prevents the higher REMB from properly ramping the BWE up again in time.\n\nRather than trying to fix that fragile and complicated test I replaced it with a Scenario-based one\ninstead.\nptal!",
