      "message": "I wondered about that too, given that these functions take an excessive number of member references from peerconnection. I may move them back. But they are never called from anywhere but SdpOfferAnswerHandler, indicating that they don\u0027t really belong in peerconnection\u0027s public surface either.\n\nI\u0027ll leave them in SdpOfferAnswerHandler for now. I suspect that we\u0027ll want to factor out the handling of channels (creation, deletion, modification) into a separate handler class that both PeerConnection and SdpOfferAnswerHandler can depend on.",
