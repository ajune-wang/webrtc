      "message": "This name (in combination with created_by_addtrack) smells bad.\n\nWhen you rollback, you set \"created_by_addtrack\" if \"modified_by_addtrack is true. Which means that these two variables are consistent after a rollback, but not before rollback. Why?\n\nThe variable is also set but never reset. Which means that if you do\n\naddtrack()\nsetLocalDescription\nrollback\nremoveTrack()\n\nthe transceiver will have no track and won\u0027t be associated with a media section, but will still hang around because it has created_by_addtrac() set, which I think is different from\n\naddTrack()\nremoveTrack()\nsetLocalDescription()\n\nwhich will have created_by_addtrack() false (because it was never rolled back).\nThis seems strange.\n\nCan you make this logic more readable?",
