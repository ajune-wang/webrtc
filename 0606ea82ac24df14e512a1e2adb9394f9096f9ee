      "message": "when we wrote it, I think msid_supported was \"the remote party supports MSID\", and msid_signaling was \"we want to send msid\". For offers, we set msid_signaling; for answers, msid_signaling would be true if msid_supported was true.\n\nSo setting \"supported\" unconditionally when msid_signaling is true isn\u0027t consistent with what I remember.\nIf we stuck to that .... heaven knows. But I\u0027d be happier if we didn\u0027t add this line.",
