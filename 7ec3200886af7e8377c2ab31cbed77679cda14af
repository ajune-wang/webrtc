I filed a bug and included some more details here:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id\u003d13681\n\nAnother thing that hangs together with this is the use of the enabled() property, when and how it\u0027s set. I\u0027ve prepared another CL for making that change, which is now a parent CL of this one.",
