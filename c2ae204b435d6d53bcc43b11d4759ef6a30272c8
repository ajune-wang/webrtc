      "message": "Since this is now specific to the spectrum buffer, and IncIdx is specific for the block_buffer I think we have a big risk of confusion  between the too.\n\nWould it be possible to instead of adding these two methods instead add getters for the block_buffer_ and spectrum_buffer_ that return const-ref objects?\n\nThat approach could then also be used to eliminate the methods on lines 81 and 84 and instead replace those operations with operations directly on the block_buffer_ and spectrum_buffer_.\n\nProbably also the method at line 42 should be included there?\n\n\nWDYT?",
