And :rtc_task_queue_api is also private.\n\nI think we should make :rtc_task_queue_api public (I think it is part of the API) and document that in order to use the default implementation a target should depend on :rtc_task_queue which, if rtc_link_task_queue_impl \u003d\u003d True, will compile and link the default implementation.\n\nWhat do you think?",
