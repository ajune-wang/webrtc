      "message": "this feels strange. The worker queue, according to comments that previously were in this file, was meant to replace module_process_thread_. Now the TQ has been moved into a different class, but module_process_thread_ is still here. Further still here, we\u0027re fetching a pointer to a member variable owned by transport_send_ptr_, and giving it to an object that\u0027s not directly aware of the lifetime of the queue or how it\u0027s managed.\n\nIs there a design doc or something that explains these architectural changes? On the surface, it seems like a step backwards to me but I\u0027m probably missing something.",

Do you mean that those instances should belong to (or at least created by) RtpTransportControllerSend instead of Call?\n\nThe idea is that RtpTransportControllerSend should encapsulate everything the send stream needs to know about the Rtp transport. RtpTransportControllerSend is passed by Call to the send stream constructors, for this purpose. Now, they also get a pointer to the TQ (and to the module_process_thread). \n\nWhat I mean is that wherever the a send stream posts something directly to this taskqueue, we should design a method on RtpTransportControllerSend (or some per-stream class it\u0027s in control of) to perform the needed operation, and possibly post on the task queue internally.\n\nA possible next step (discussed earlier on this cl) is to delete the tq argument and the GetWorkerQueue call from Call, and instead let the send streams call GetWorkerQueue when they have something to post. I think it\u0027s preferable to move GetWorkerQueue closer to where it is needed.",
