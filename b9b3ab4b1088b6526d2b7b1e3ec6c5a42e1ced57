Probably not so large that merge conflicts will be difficult to resolve, but you may want to hold off for a bit on changing DataChannelController to use SctpTransportInternal instead of DataChannelTransportInterface.\n\nAlso, in the end I want to cut out the middleman and have SctpDataChannel use SctpTransportInternal, instead of going through SctpDataChannelProviderInterface. DataChannelController would then just be responsible for connecting them up.",
