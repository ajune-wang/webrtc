      "message": "\"Force\" sounds like this function is doing something, but it\u0027s just a lookup from name etc to codec capabilities. I suggest renaming it to something like ObtainCodecCapabilities().\n\nSince this can return multiple codecs I would document that if multiple codecs match (for example different profiles of H.264) they will be returned in |supported_codecs| order. This is not an implementation detail; it will affect what is negotiated. Also comment that FEC and RTX is added to the end of the list, even though the order of that part doesn\u0027t matter AFAIK",
