      "message": "If integration tests are needed, they need to cover negotiation - an incoming offer SDP with \"a\u003drtcp-fb:nack\" (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4585#section-9) should be the remote side asking for nack support; the responding answer should indicate nack support.\n\nI\u0027m not sure integration tests are needed here; it may be sufficient to use lower level structures to set up a transport and an RTP session, and fire a nack across the wire, in which case this CL doesn\u0027t need to do SDP.\n\nBut I do think there should be at least one unit test actually receiving a nack, and verifying that the counter is incremented.",
