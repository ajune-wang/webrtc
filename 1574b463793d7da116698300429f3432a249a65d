By reading https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/Documentation/path-expressions.html#simplePathExpressions it looks like that can happen (maybe that is not a realistic thing?), so I decided to use the double rule.\n \n\u003e From the docu it\u0027s not clear to me if 4 dots always resolve the 3 dots first?
