      "message": "Part of me it tempted to land this one.\n\nOne thing I am worried is that X months from now, something in clang-format will change and that will be a change in the DEPS file (pointing to a new version of the compiler tools) and I suspect this will not trigger a full format. From that moment on, all the people touching any file will upload CLs with more changes compared to the ones they wanted to make.\n\nDoes this make sense?",
