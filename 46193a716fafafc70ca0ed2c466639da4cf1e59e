      "message": "Hi Peter!\nSorry for the delay.\nSo, when I use RTCMTLRenderer inside UICollectionViewCell and applying mirroring to it with CGAffineTransform(scaleX: -1, y: 1) it causes artifacts in landscape orientation(see videos below). It can rotate and squash video, can freeze display(main queue in free, actually i can press buttons, but Display is not updating). And they causes only sometimes. If I use OpenGL version of renderer - everything works fine. Looks like it\u0027s some Metal problem.\n\nSo i decided to make this - if we rotating video inside renderer, why we can\u0027t mirror it here, if we need? That\u0027s why i implement it. And seems to me, it\u0027s also better in performance.\n\nVideos here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Gzz8DauxbnmiUCPyjsj4BjPsoe_Ijs3?usp\u003dsharing",
