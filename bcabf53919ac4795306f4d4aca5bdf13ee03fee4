But LGTM for now since we have other problems to fix in the PinPoint integration. Can you add a TODO(bugs.webrtc.org/XXX) with the request to move this somewhere else?\n\n\u003e For perftests in Pinpoint, their swarming command runs run_performance_tests.py and the creation of the directory happens here:\n\u003e https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:testing/scripts/run_performance_tests.py;l\u003d136\n\nAlso, should we use exist_ok\u003dTrue as a second argument to avoid errors in case the directory is already there (and maybe clean it before starting the test) or that is impossible?",
