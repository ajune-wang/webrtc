May also help with a function-level comment giving some background on what the various conditions in this method try to achieve.\n\nAs I read this code block, this means that if we have a single simulcast stream, and that stream is configured with multiple spatial layers, then we always allow \"adaptation up\", and ignore any bitrate limits? But it\u0027s not obvious why that\u0027s the right thing to do.",
