Here the assumption is that CheckRtpParamters.. doesn\u0027t need to be called with the list of codecs, because it is already checked further up the stack.\n\nI\u0027d like to document that by doing an RTC_DCHECK(CheckRtpParameters...) with a comment saying \"This was already checked in AddTransceiver\".\n\nIf there are paths to here that don\u0027t go through AddTransceiver (such as by SetParameters), those paths should also do the check for SVC mode values.\n\nIf it\u0027s too much of a bother doing this properly now, just add a TODO with bug number.",
