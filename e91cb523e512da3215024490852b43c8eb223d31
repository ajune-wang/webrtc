      "message": "is this now the only place where we construct a OwnedFactoryAndThreads instance?\n\nIf so.. do you mind changing it so that it doesn\u0027t hold a raw pointer to PeerConnectionFactoryInterface but rather uses scoped_refptr? (and remove the call to Release() in the dtor)\n\nIf you do that, then you can do a std::move() here instead of .release(), which often raises concerns when reviewing code, and it should also be possible to make the factory_ variable in OwnedFactoryAndThreads, const.\n\nThe network_monitor_factory implementation also raises a few questions - the design seems to be very open to the potential of running into dangling pointers. Outside of the scope of this CL I guess though.",
