And that should probably stay disabled.\n\nShould this be replaced by RTC_DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN, or is explicit delete the recommended way?

The advantage is that is more readable to someone not familiar with C++. OTH it\u0027s less readable to anyone not familiar with WebRTC (who would have to double check that it only does the expected thing, nothing else)\n\nSeeing as we have that macro, it might make most sense to use it.

      "message": "It\u0027s a pre-C++11 thing; disabling copying and assignment used to be much more of a hack than it is today, so it made sense to encapsulate it in a macro. IIUC, we got the macro from Chromium, who got it from the Google code base.\n\nThe Google style guide no longer recommends its use [https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Copyable_Movable_Types]; my opinion is that we should get rid of it. But a simple search indicates that we use these macros in almost 500 classes, so it\u0027s going to be a bit of a chore.",
