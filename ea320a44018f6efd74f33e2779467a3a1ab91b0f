I believe there was one more thing we were supposed to check before deciding that we don\u0027t need it.\n\nShould we have an asynchronous stream creation?

      "message": "Hmm. I think it would make sense with a callback OnNewReceiveStream(int channel_id), depending on transport configuration, and creating the receive stream state when the first frame is received. But that\u0027s mostly orthogonal to this change; we still need the CreateReceiver call, if we want to stick with the frame sink being a construction-time const.\n\nAnd my current understanding of \"unsignalled\" streams is that they shouldn\u0027t appear out of the blue; in the rtp case, they\u0027ll correspond to a signalled m-line, it\u0027s just not specifying any ssrc or mid in advance.",
