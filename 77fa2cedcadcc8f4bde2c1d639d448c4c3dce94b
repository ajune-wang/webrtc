      "message": "I was sure variable length arrays (a c99 feature, right? And supported by gcc since the beginning) was mainstream C and C++ these days. But the msvc build bot complains that the size isn\u0027t constant, and some downstream project seems to be built with -Wvla, essentially forbidding this language feature. So it appears I was wrong about that.\n\nEven better would be to allocate the string and pass the storage to ::MultibyteToWideChar, avoiding copying via a stack buffer. I\u0027ll try that.\n\nIf forbidding variable length arrays really is desired, should we add -Wvla to all webrtc builds?",
