      "message": "Yes, I thought about it and decided to restrict to macOS arm just to be sure we are not breaking downstream clients with unsupported configs but in that case they are probably already doing more changes than the ones required here. So I am open to simplify (waiting for Henrik and Per\u0027s review).",

      "message": "Would it somehow be possible to instead let the clients more explicitly choose the complexity rather than have a default complexity as a constant via #defines?\nWhat the right complexity is is a moving target as CPUs become more powerful, and what is right for one ARM platform is likely not right for another.\n\nI would advocate for always having a default complexity of 9, and let the clients explicitly set something else if they think that is more appropriate.\n\nRegarding the #define, I don\u0027t have any real opinion rather than that I think we should move away from having it. Maybe the best option would be to use Mirkos safer choice now, and the try to remove everything?",
