      "message": "How does a *callee* transceiver affect this test when it is the *caller* creating the offer, i.e. it is only the caller\u0027s transceiver that is given a mid. The callee transceiver needs to be negotiated in a callee O/A, so it shouldn\u0027t matter if this transceiver was created before or after the caller O/A.",

      "message": "Why is fallback happening? It looks to me like the callee is accepting the SDP answer without modifications.\n\nThe callee could affect codec preferences by doing GetTransceivers() to obtain the transceiver that was created by the SDP offer and calling SetCodecPreferences() on that transceiver, but in this case it is only setting the codec preferences on the callee transceiver which isn\u0027t up for negotiation yet (as per previous comment).",
