      "message": "Eldar, does it make sense to you that this is sometimes undefined?\n\nThe unittest is not running for long enough to make stuff ramp up, so it\u0027s possible that its flaky because not enough frames have been processed yet. So I think it makes sense that we see a flake and this CL would fix that problem, just want to make sure we\u0027re not hiding a real issue here.",

      "message": "Can we make this conditional on other values rather than randomly accepting missing?\nI\u0027d suggest insisting that it\u0027s present if frames_encoded \u003e\u003d 2, and that it\u0027s undefined if frames_encoded \u003c 2. It seems that this function is called from VerifyStats, which is called from a large number of places - at least one of the tests should wait until 2 frames have been transmitted, so that we\u0027re reasonably sure we cover at least that case.",
