      "message": "Hi, Niels Moller.\n\nSorry for not reporting the bug.\nI\u0027m not familiar with this kinds of system.\nI\u0027ll explain this issue.\n\nThis log should print removed elements in \u0027networks\u0027 which pointer to vector\u003cNetwork*\u003e really.\nBut it was printing just tailing elements of the vector.\n\nFor example, assume that there are 4 elements in \u0027networks\u0027, and 1st and 3rd elements are removed. Then \u0027networks\u0027 will be changed like this.\n\n\u003cBefore\u003e\n[0] id \u003d 1\n[1] id \u003d 2\n[2] id \u003d 3\n[3] id \u003d 4\n\n\u003cAfter\u003e\n[0] id \u003d 2\n[1] id \u003d 4\n\nThen this log should print the elements with id\u003d1 and id\u003d3 which removed. \nBut currently it is printing the elements with id\u003d3 and id\u003d4 which tailing 2 elements of the vector.\nIt\u0027s related with how std::remove_if works.\nhttp://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/remove_if/?kw\u003dremove_if\n\nI hope this explanation will help you.\nThanks!",
