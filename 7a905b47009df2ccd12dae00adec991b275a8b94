      "message": "Is this part still PoC? Some questions:\n\n1) Is this behavior specified somewhere? If so, link in the comments.\n2) Can you make a helper that converts from the raw network priority to an enum, since this is used in two places? Not sure which names are preferred (VeryLow/Low/Medium/High or BelowNormal/Normal/High/ExtraHigh). Also make sure float comparisons don\u0027t use \u003d\u003d, seems like these should probably be both \u003c\u003d and use an epsilon.\n3) It seems weird that if I set both video and audio to High, they\u0027ll have different markings. Though if this is all specified somewhere, then that\u0027s fine.",
