      "message": "I have looked into this recently. The reason why it causes video delay is that the max delay \u003c min delay. The previous code executed clamp as,\n  \n  std::min(max_delay, std::max(min_delay, delay))\n  \nClamped() does\n  \n  std::max(min_delay, std::min(max_delay, delay))\n  \nThe order does not matter so long as min_delay \u003c max_delay. However, clamp is undefined. \n\nLikely what is happening is that there is a conflict in the delay values set. This can happen if the delay header extension is used at the same time as a playout hint.\nIt would have been better before to have a warning to the user that there was a delay conflict but that case was not known until now.",
