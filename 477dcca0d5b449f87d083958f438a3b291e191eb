It should own a const field trial flag and then combine it with whatever stream related logic as needed.\n\nThen this method could be just SetEnabled or current name works also.\n\nThat way we won\u0027t have plethora of confusing |enabled_by_whatever| flags.",

Let VSE decide what to do, and just leave the details of doing it to the FrameCadenceAdapter class(es).\n\nBut I don\u0027t have a strong opinion on this. There are already half a dozen field trials in VSE, so it would be nice if setup of new field trials are organized in a consistent way.",
