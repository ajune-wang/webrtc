      "message": "Will add tests for that. \n\nHowever, in Chrome as of today this falling back to VP8 is not likely to happen - for every hardware encoding failure we have SW fallbacks for the same codec type.\n\nIt is only after we enable H.265, that this really becomes an issue. So we block the future potential of by default falling back to VP8. In that sense I think we don\u0027t need to keep the previous behavior and setup a metric for that.\n\nAccording to spec: \"The setCodecPreferences method overrides the default receive codec preferences used by the user agent. When generating a session description using either createOffer or createAnswer, the user agent MUST use the indicated codecs, in the order specified in the codecs argument, for the media section corresponding to this RTCRtpTransceiver.\"\n\nWith all above mentioned, I think we should not need to justify why we change the default behavior of falling back to VP8.  It does not make sense of falling back to VP8: what if setCodecPrefernces() remove VP8 from codec list? We cannot blindly use VP8 when falling back.",

      "message": "Personally I am less concerned about landing this CL as-is because in most cases, including Chrome*, you always have SW to fall back to and so I would suspect that \"prefer VP8\" is ancient native app logic rather than something that makes sense going forward.\n\n( * ) Now there are probably exception for this: I *think* Chrome Android has H264 as HW-only for possibly binary size reasons, and same for non-Chrome native apps. But I\u0027m still not alarmed because we\u0027re falling back to a codec that was negotiated and a codec that was negotiated should always work and VP8 should likely be next on the list anyway. But there\u0027s that word again, \"should\"... who knows.\n\nIf we do want a kill switch, can it be minimal like gating the logic in video_stream_encoder.cc:1489 on a field trial not being \"/Disabled/\" (\u003d so it is enabled-by-default)?",
