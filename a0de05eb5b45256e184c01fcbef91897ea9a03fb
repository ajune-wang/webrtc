Change looks reasonable to me; another mutex is somewhat undesirable, but config logic should not be performance critical. \n\nThe mutex can be avoided if we\u0027re willing to accept a data race in the error case, like in this related code: https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/226328/8/rtc_base/synchronization/mutex_pthread.h",
