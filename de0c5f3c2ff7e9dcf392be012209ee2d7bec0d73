      "message": "I think it would, I had the very same idea.\nHowever, when testing know problematic situations this fix seems to be enough in practice. I\u0027m therefore trying mitigate risk by doing this first (with the intention of cherry-picking it if possible) and then adding the TL-0 enforcement separately. I think the latter may have an effect also on \"Zero-Hz\" situations so would be good with staging for that reason too.",
