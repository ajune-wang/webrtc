      "message": "I still don\u0027t understand why this mapping is needed. I would suggest:\n\n1. Keep latest frame id per ssrc in the rtp_payload_states mapping, as part of RtpPayloadState (it\u0027s already there, for non-simulcast, right?)\n\n2. When creating a simulcast stream, look up latest frame id for each involved ssrc, take the maximum, and pass that to the code responsible for allocating new frame ids (VideoSendStream, if I understood you correctly). Not sure if the code to take the maximum even needs to be in Call, perhaps it can be delegated to VideoSendStream?\n\nAny reason that won\u0027t work?",
