I don\u0027t think we need to merge this one, since it\u0027s only removing api_lock_ locking, but anywhere this lock is acquired it\u0027s the only one. So it can\u0027t cause a deadlock.\n\nWe can\u0027t merge it to M115, since it\u0027s already passed the stable cut and the severity of the fixed issue is not emergency.",
