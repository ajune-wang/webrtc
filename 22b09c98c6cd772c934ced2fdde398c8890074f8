      "message": "I believe that this macro works just like the Chromium ones do, and must be called with a runtime-constant name. I think you want \"RTC_HISTOGRAM_PERCENTAGE_SPARSE\"... though that macro is really poorly named, as it\u0027s not actually a sparse histogram, it\u0027s just a slower implementation for a regular enumerated histogram. It would be great if WebRTC could either use the code from Chromium //base, or at least duplicate it more closely.",
