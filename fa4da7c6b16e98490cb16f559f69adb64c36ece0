      "message": "Approving this CL. No matter what the rest of the redesign does, dropping these orphan packets is the Right Thing to do.\n(Note: it\u0027s critical that the criteria version *not* increment when the criteria are not changed - otherwise, packets will be dropped gratuitously whenever the SDP is updated. This CL is OK with that - but you might want to add a test that packets are not dropped on criteria non-change - the inverse of your current test - so that this remains true in the future.)\n",
