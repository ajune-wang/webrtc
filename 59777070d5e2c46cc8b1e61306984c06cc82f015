      "message": "This CL includes some behavior changes, please let me know if any of them are not expected.\n\n1. When `h264_idr_only_keyframes_allowed` is false, IDR frames without SPS/PPS are not returned by InsertPacket until SPS and PPS are received. Old packet buffer implementation returns it as a delta frame when `sps_pps_idr_is_h264_keyframe_` is true.\n1. H264SpsPpsTracker no longer returns fixed bitstream, it returns a prefix for SPS and PPS. H26xPacketBuffer prepend the prefix to the original bitstream.\n1. Start code for H.264 is inserted by H26xPacketBuffer.",
