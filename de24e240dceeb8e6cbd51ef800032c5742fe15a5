      "message": "hbos@ mentioned in that doc that this returns all senders (whether active or not). I think this still works in the case of a removed track because it will just call AddTrack below with a null track, but what about the case with a stopped transceiver? I could be wrong, but it seems like for this case a sender would still be returned here and we would call AddTrack even though the transceiver and sender were stopped. I don\u0027t think we\u0027re hitting that case necessarily, but since this is an example it would probably be good to demonstrate the difference between local_streams() and GetSenders() - even if it\u0027s just a comment :).",
