      "message": "kMaxAudioLevel is used below in this method. Can this be deleted too? It looks like it contains the main logic of CurrentSpeakerMonitor. It\u0027s connected to audio_source_context_-\u003eSignalAudioMonitor, which appears to be called only from currentspeakermonitor_unittest.cc.\n\nSo I\u0027m a bit confused, before this cl, was CurrentSpeakerMonitor wired up to AudioMonitor in some non-obvious way?",
