Remember that this isn\u0027t actually \"first packet received for the receiver\"; if we have two video receivers, the first video packet destined for *either* of them will cause them *both* to signal \"first packet received\" because (with Plan B) they share a MediaChannel. Hopefully after enough refactoring we can fix that, and then we can change the comment.",
