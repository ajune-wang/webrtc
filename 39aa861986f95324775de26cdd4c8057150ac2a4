      "message": "I think we should avoid leaking RTP information outside the RTP layer. I know there\u0027s already timestamp_rtp, but I think that should be renamed to timestamp_90khz. I suggest you extract the parts of the RtpPacketInfo that makes sense for a VideoFrame and only attach that information to the frame. Most likely there\u0027s no need to attach one instance for each packet that a frame consists of on the RTP layer.",
