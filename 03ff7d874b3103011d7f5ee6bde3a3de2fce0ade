Now we seem to assume a center crop.\n\nThis is the same as AdaptFrame, which produces dimensions for scaling:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/media/base/adapted_video_track_source.h?rcl\u003dfd0e32a87a4e6a9a6cfeb02fbdcddd6edf4ac9c8\u0026l\u003d52\n\nThere\u0027re no offsets, just the cropped dimensions.\n\n\u003e Also, an I420 center-crop would have to round the crop offsets to even. Should we do that here too? \n\nThis is done right after scaling.\n\n\u003e To get 100% consistency between the UpdateRect and the cropped and scaled frame, one would need to pass UpdateRect to the function implementing the scaling, but I take it that\u0027s impractical?\n\nYes. Unfortunately we will need to keep that updated if we change scaling functions for frames.",
