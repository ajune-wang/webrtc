This CL doesn\u0027t touch CopyOnWriteBuffer.\n\nTo my mind, the normal usage of Buffer is that you append to it until you have everything you need - you can set an initial guess at the size, but there\u0027s only a small performance hit if you overrun - no logic function change - and you\u0027re still guaranteed that all the data is available in one contiguous memory area.\n\nFrom CS, it seems that each of the various setter-functions is called ~15 times in the whole codebase - the constructor I\u0027m disliking is not very prominently represented. (Most of the code changes above are in tests)",
