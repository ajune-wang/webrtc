      "message": "I think there\u0027s a conflict in these comments. In the standard API, \"process-remote-track-addition\" may occur for a track that was already created (for example, if the direction flips to \"inactive\" then back to \"sendrecv\"). And \"process-remote-track-removal\" may occur when the receiver isn\u0027t completely removed, for the same reason.\n\nSo, if we\u0027re deciding these callbacks are only called when the receiver is first created and when it\u0027s permanently stopped, I\u0027d remove the \"process-X\" links, since they may be misleading.",
