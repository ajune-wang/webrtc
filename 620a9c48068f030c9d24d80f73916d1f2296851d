They are probably not using SDK to inject custom ADM. Or they might compile SDK with their own patches. In general I prefer not having custom patches, so that\u0027s why I\u0027m creating an API to inject custom ObjC ADM with means of SDK.\n\nThere is also `RTCPeerConnectionFactoryBuilder.h` header in sdk source code, which provides object which allows to inject custom ADM written in C++. But it relies on the fact that it should be possible to implement ADM interface which is located in [header](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/modules/audio_device/include/audio_device.h;l\u003d1) `modules/audio_device/include/audio_device.h` which is not exposed in ObjC SDK. The `RTCPeerConnectionFactoryBuilder.h` is [also not part of SDK](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/sdk/BUILD.gn;l\u003d1205-1291) and I\u0027m not sure who and how uses it. I only see it is used [in test](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/sdk/objc/unittests/RTCPeerConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.mm;l\u003d22).",
