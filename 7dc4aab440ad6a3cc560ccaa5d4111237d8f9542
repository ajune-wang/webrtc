      "message": "Sorry for the back and forth on this; honestly this is implementing something for a single capturer that accomplishes the same goal as a design-doc-worthy task that we eventually want to do for all of the capturers. I\u0027m trying to ensure we\u0027re not taking on too much tech debt or getting too boxed into a corner here, but haven\u0027t had time to consider the full architecture we will ultimately want.",

      "message": "Sorry, I think there\u0027s two parts here:\n1) Understanding if the capturer supports sending you frames as soon as they are ready.\n2) The client opting in to receive frames like this. The non-CRD capture stack is not setup to receive evented frames right now either, so we don\u0027t want to send this.\n\nI think you all directly hold a BaseCapturerPipeWire? I\u0027m wondering if it wouldn\u0027t be better to just only expose a \"SetDeliverFramesWhenReady\" on it rather than tweaking the public interface at this time.",
