      "message": "The problem might be a design problem. Using TaskQueue this way is different from all other use of TaskQueue, which introduces behavior one can consider to be surprising and also sets a precedence I\u0027m not sure we want to set (at least not before having the chance of thinking it through).",

      "message": "I agree that this code is very different from other usages of TaskQueue. I also want to note that this is the only place where `PlatformThread::SpawnDetached` is used.\nI don\u0027t think this kind of use of global concurrent queues is welcomed in most other codes. So, I think it would be a good idea to move the current CL\u0027s global queue-related code to where it\u0027s actually used in order to think twice before using such things in another place if that\u0027s your concern.",
