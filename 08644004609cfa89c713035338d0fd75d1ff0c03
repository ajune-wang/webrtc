You can only send what is negotiated, and you can only respond with what was offered, so what the list contains matters for both sending and receiving.\n\nWe need to support both the send-only and recv-only use cases and what the W3C setCodecPreferences() decides to do could be subtly different from the JSEP setCodecPreferences().",
