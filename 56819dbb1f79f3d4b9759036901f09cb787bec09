      "message": "LGTM - I don\u0027t see how leaving the data channel transport invoker around is going to harm anything.\n\nI\u0027m always worried about changes with no tests - a test that showed an effect would involve doing something that fires a signal that should have been handled after transport teardown. But the new lifetime seems unlikely to cause new issues.\n",

      "message": "From my understanding, the semantics of RTC_GUARDED_BY is different now - this says that you can only invoke from the network thread; the previous said that you could only modify the pointer on the network thread. The new meaning is strictly narrower than the old, and I think it\u0027s a Good Thing.",
