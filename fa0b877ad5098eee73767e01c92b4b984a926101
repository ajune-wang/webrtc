      "message": "It seems a bit strange to me to have a unit of frames here, since the playout delay extension signals time in ms.\n\nIt would seem more natural with a max_render_delay_ms, or maybe even better with a timestamp with latest render time. Would be good to know how it interacts with the other frame timestamps, timestamp_us() and render_time_ms() below, I\u0027m not really familiar with how they are used on the receive side.\n\nMore abstractly, timestamps make sense as frame metadata, but a configured maximum delay isn\u0027t quite a per-frame property, is it?",

      "message": "What we\u0027re trying to achieve is to postpone the decision of dropping a frame or not to as late as possible. We\u0027ve found that a pragmatic way of making this decision possible in the compositor is to provide the information included in |max_composition_delay_in_frames|. The renderer will take different decisions depending on the total queue size in relation to |max_composition_delay_in_frames|.\n\nI\u0027ll investigate what the consequences would be of refactoring to a |max_render_delay_ms|, for now I would like to keep counting number of frames to enable wider experimentation with this strategy which has shown positive results in local experiments.\n\nI agree that it\u0027s not a per-frame property in a conventional way. However, it\u0027s a per-frame property in the sense that it provides information about how relevant this frame is in a low-latency context. If there are several frames in the decode queue, we would set |max_composition_delay_in_frames| to a lower number and indicate to the compositor that this frame might be dropped because there are several newer frames coming soon.",
