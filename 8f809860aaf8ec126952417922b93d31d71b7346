      "message": "Restored now.\n\nI removed a couple of #includes here that are already in the header file. VideoDecoder is used as part of the VideoReceiver2 class declaration.\n\nHowever it\u0027s clearly been a while since I last reviewed this part of the guidelines. Wrt this part of the guidelines:\n```\nThis also applies to related headers - foo.cc should include bar.h if it uses a symbol from it even if foo.h includes bar.h.\n```\nI\u0027m pretty sure we don\u0027t follow that to a tee. Do you interpret it as an implementation of a previously declared function must also include the headers that must already have been included for the sake of the declaration?",

      "message": "yes, I watch what iwyu tools suggests and try to do the same.\n\npreviously style guide didn\u0027t require to include headers in foo.cc if they are already included in the foo.h, but few years ago the rule had changed.\nOne of the reasons - to make job of the iwyu tool simpler (it no longer need to guess what is a \u0027related header\u0027 and track those).\n\nNo, we do not follow that rule, we use transitive includes often, it is very hard to follow that rule manually.\nWhen I notice violation during review or own change - I do comment, but I do not worry much about this rule. It is annoying to fix transitive dependencies, and remove unused includes during a refactor, but with webrtc size it is less work than to carefully manually watch for this rule.",
