      "message": "I think we want PostDelayedTaskAt(), but I definitely see the point that the current consumers of PostDelayedHighPrecisionTask() does not care about current clock time.\n\nPostDelayedTaskAt() is a more powerful API for coalescing tasks since it allows multiple tasks to happen at the same time and is now available in Chrome. We are currently refactoring the MetronomeTaskQueue to make use of Chrome\u0027s PostDelayedTaskAt() which gets rid of a ton of complexity and a metronome thread. I think having access to it inside WebRTC could improve SyncDecoding and may be useful for future \"reduce idle wake up\" projects.\n\nBut hw about we don\u0027t remove PostDelayedHighPrecisionTask() since today\u0027s consumers don\u0027t care about clock time? I think the goal should be to make that a non-virtual helper method that calls PostDelayedTaskAt() and to make PDTA the virtual method.\n\nThis would make this CL a lot smaller too since you don\u0027t have to update all calling places, just the webrtc::TaskQueueBase interface.",

      "message": "Hi Etienne, thanks for the patch!\n\nI think it might be too early for this kind of change right now and it\u0027s more dangerous than overriding HighPrecision in the wrappers since webrtc consumers are switched from reltime to abstime. Additionally I think this kind of change requires a design doc as there\u0027s a fair degree of ambiguity (abstime inception before Timestamp migration? API having the right fidelity?) and there are many interested parties in WebRTC.\n\nLet\u0027s revisit a little later, wdyt?",

      "message": "I drafted go/webrtc-post-task-at\nPTAL and feel free to share with interested parties. We can use it as a cheaper medium to discuss the more controversial bits (e.g. Timestamp).\n\nFrom where I stand, this doesn\u0027t block experimenting with coalescing low precision tasks in webrtc, as you mentioned overriding HighPrecision is a cheaper way to do it and can be done independently. It would be nice however if we have PostDelayedTaskAt once we\u0027re ready to experiment.\nI believe there are additional benefits in exposing PostDelayedTaskAt() (which Henrik described and I\u0027ve tried to outline in the doc), but there are also extra complexity in exposing a new API, and all the ambiguity that absolute time brings. If there\u0027s ongoing work with Timestamp (I lack context here) that would eventually make this easier, I\u0027m happy with punting. Otherwise I would like to move forward with the proposal.",

      "message": "For new APIs I would also be tempted to make use of webrtc::Timestamp. We previously decided that changing the type of the delay to webrtc::TimeDelta would introduce risk of rounding errors and we kept uint32_t for delays. But if we keep the old APIs as-is, and PostDelayedTaskAt() is a completely new API, then any callers of it would necessarily be new code and not regressing existing stuff, so to me it would seem perfectly safe to use webrtc::Timestamp here.\n\nMarkus what do you think?",
