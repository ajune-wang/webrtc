      "message": "Found that the Android APK test somehow holds on to a reference to a stopped transceiver that is destroyed on a different thread, and the changes (probably marginal) lead to this reference surviving the expected lifetime of the transceiver, leading to the transceiver destructor being called on a different thread.\n\nThis should be OK as long as the transceiver is stopped on the signaling thread; changed DCHECKs to reflect this.\n",
