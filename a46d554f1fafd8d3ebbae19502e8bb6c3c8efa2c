And sequence numbers are sequential.\nSo a report on SSRC\u003d123;begin_seq\u003d72,num_reports\u003d3 followed by a later report having SSRC\u003d123;begin_seq\u003d75,num_reports\u003d3 will indicate that all packets from 72 to 77 have been reported on; having the second report have begin_seq\u003d74,num_reports\u003d4 would seem to me to give no additional information.",
