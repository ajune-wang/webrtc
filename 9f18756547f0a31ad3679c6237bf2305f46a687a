      "message": "For lsocket, it worked fine to drop SignalAddressReady(). My rough understanding is that when state is BOUND, the below call to lport-\u003ePrepareAddress() does whatever is needed to register the port (essentially calling Port::AddAddress, but I haven\u0027t grokked the meaning of all the arguments).\n\nThe calls to AddAddress look identical in TCPPort::OnAddressReady and TCPPort::PrepareAddress (under the assumption that socket_ is non-null and socket_-\u003eGetLocalAddress() returns the configured address).\n\nBut doing the same to rsocket breaks the test, with rport-\u003eCandidates().empty() being true. Jonas, can you help out, as author of this test?",
