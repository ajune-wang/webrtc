Right/bottom are only correct if top/left are, so this comment left me wondering what\u0027s special about them that means they don\u0027t need special treatment.\n\nTo put it another way, if bottom/right are correct here, they are wrong after you call translate().",

I think a comment along the lines of \"translate the cropped rect such that left -\u003e horizontal_scale * left\" would have made it more obvious (you basically just want to update top/left without changing width/height, but the DesktopRect doesn\u0027t have an API for that).",
