For example, is the receiver surprised by not receiving high fps? Do we quickly reach a stable 1 fps or will key frames repeatedly happen causing \u003e1 fps?",

After some thought I think this might however be a bad idea:\n\nIf the shared content is in fact animating media, then the refresh frame will unconditionally be inserted in a stream of 30 Hz content, leading to local frame spacings being lower than 1/30. That will cause the encoder to use too much BW for the frames and lead to bitrate debt.\n\nThe alternative is better. The probability of a remote keyframe request happens at the same time as the source is beginning to burp out frames is very small in comparison.",
