I\u0027ve landed one CL that contains an interface change from the original CL and is therefore no longer a part of the re-land.\n\nI also discovered a few unexpected ways of doing things in downstream code, which I have fixed and I have a couple of pending CLs in Chromium for code that is ready for these changes and takes advantage of the already-landed interface change.\n\nI made some changes from the original CL though in order to harden the code against situations I saw downstream and those changes can be seen by diffing patch sets 4 and 21 (yes, it\u0027s been a bit of an adventure):\n\nhttps://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/300360/4..21",
