      "message": "No, much more files may happen to be built.\n\nThe ninja doc (https://ninja-build.org/manual.html#_running_ninja) states:\n\"\"\"There is also a special syntax target^ for specifying a target as the first output of some rule containing the source you put in the command line, if one exists. For example, if you specify target as foo.c^ then foo.o will get built (assuming you have those targets in your build files).\"\"\"\n\nThe doc is not yet entirely clear to me, but in practice, invoking `ninja ../../modules/audio_coding/codecs/opus/audio_decoder_opus.cc` ends up taking 274 steps before arriving to:\n[275/275] CXX obj/modules/audio_coding/webrtc_opus/audio_decoder_opus.o\nThat takes 5 minutes, which is not acceptable for a presubmit check.",
