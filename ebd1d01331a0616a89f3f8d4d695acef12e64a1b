      "message": "This change means that the code is no longer local.\nI.e., the maximum number of channels, and the supported maximum sample rate, is no longer only controlled and self-contained by the AudioBuffer.\n\nAlso, we have a situation where we still have AudioBuffer::kMaxSampleRate, but where kMaxSamplesPerChannel now are specified by audio_util.h. \n\nThey have matching values now as AudioBuffer::kMaxSampleRate\u003dwebrtc::kMaxSampleRate\nbut I think it makes the code a bit more fragile. \nI think this change is ok though if we remove AudioBuffer::kMaxSampleRate or if we add a todo+plan to remove it.",
