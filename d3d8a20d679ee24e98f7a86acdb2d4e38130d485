      "message": "RTC_DCHECK means that it is ignorable in release builds but crashes in debug builds. When we know that this occasionally crashes, this is an iffy thing to do -  SetCodec is a void-returning function; it is not supposed to be able to fail, so ignoring the update will leave the system in an inconsistent state.\n\nMaking it an RTC_CHECK will make it always crash in a safe manner. Is that better?",
