      "message": "There are several \"send\" and \"update\" codepaths, which makes me wonder if this solves the problem or just one of the symptoms.\n\nFor example, SendDataMessages() can also happen as a result of calling Send().\nIs it safe to try to send?\n\nUpdateState() can also happen as a result of other methods, like SetSendSsrc or SetReceiveSsrc. Is that fine?\n\nThis does look like an improvement, but before LGTM\u0027ing I want to see if you\u0027ve considered this and whether or not it is a good idea to simply Close() the data channel if we are unable to obtain an ID?",
