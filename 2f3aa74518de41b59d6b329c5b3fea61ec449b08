      "message": "Thanks, I think that goes in the right direction that way.\n\nFor context, weâ€™re making changes to the way we access field trials, and access should change from using the `field_trial::FindFullName` function to use an object implementing https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/api/field_trials.h, that will be injected where needed.\n\nSo ultimately accesses like the one in https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/260220 will have to change, and the `FieldTrialView` java equivalent will likely be injected in the encoder constructor. So this change, by introducing a `FieldTrial` class, is probably a good base for those future changes (even if the method will have to change to be non-static at some point).",
