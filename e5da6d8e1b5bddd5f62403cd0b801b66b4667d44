I would be more natural under api/video, either in the video_frame_api or possible a new target.\n\nWould be cleanest to fix in the same cl, to not increase the number of nogncheck. Suggestions?",

      "message": "I put videosinkinterface into api because it\u0027s used downstream, but the particular downstream user has a special agreement to use internal guts anyway so perhaps that was the wrong call. Do you mean you will move videosinkinterface.h out of api in a later cl then and fix the nogncheck? Otherwise you should not be adding //nognchecks.",
