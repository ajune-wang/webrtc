      "message": "Following up on my previous cl which modified some mocks so we didn\u0027t duplicate them in our client. This CL adds missing mocks (and in the case of MockAudioTrack makes the default constructor public). This would allow us to delete our mocks and have the mocks live alongside the mocked code. Appreciate any feedback y\u0027all have, is this the right move for the codebase?",
