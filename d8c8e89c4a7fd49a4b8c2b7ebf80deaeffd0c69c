      "message": "I think this shows that using the \"static const char kType[]\" for type checks is fundamentally flawed when it comes to hierarchies.\n\nIdea for a follow-up CL to fix this: Can we have an enum class with all the enums?\n\nThat way there is just one type value for kMediaSource, and casting from between audio/video and its parent would not DCHECK fail?\n\ntype() could return a string based on a lookup table mapping enums to strings.\nkType could eventually be deleted, but probably needed until dependencies stop using it",
