      "message": "Yeah this is odd, and broken. Upon construction the sender is assigned the track\u0027s ID (or a random ID if no track was used). When you replaceTrack(), the sender ID isn\u0027t updated... it\u0027s hard to say what implications this has or if there can be miscommunication between peers upon renegotiation. Is it really \"track_id\" or is it more like \"sender_id\"?\n\nI also don\u0027t think we can rely on any ID coming from tracks to be unique when senders and receivers can outlive tracks being added and removed.\n\nI believe adding and removing the same track in chromium can result in multiple webrtc layer tracks with the same ID. Testing is required.",
