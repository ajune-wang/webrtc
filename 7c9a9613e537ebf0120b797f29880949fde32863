      "message": "The problem is that the lower layers (such as AudioSendStream and APM) have no way of knowing if there are receive streams. If there are no receive streams, the stats get stuck, but the low level components have no way of knowing that. If there was a way to set this on a lower level I agree that it would be nicer, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to do that.\nIf you know a more appropriate layer to put this logic I would be happy to move it, but it needs to be at a lever where the number of receive streams is known (so higher than APM/AudioSendStream). One option would be add an argument to the GetStatistics call to pass the number of receive streams to the lower layers, and make the stats Optional in there. Do you think that would be a better solution?",

      "message": "If the module that is reporting a stat needs to know some information in order to correctly report the stat, I would rather have that passed as an argument (or some other way of telling the module about that). The argument could be optional if you want to support GetStatistics without knowing the number of receive streams, in which case it wouldn\u0027t return those stats.\n\nThe stat not resetting would mean the wrong stat is reported as soon as a receive stream is re-added, but if the stats converge quickly this wouldn\u0027t be a big problem I guess.\n\nIf you can reset the stats to \"no value\" on the event of the last receive stream being removed, the stats would remain \"no value\" until further notice, and avoid the problem of being tainted with what was previously reported.",
