I guess that\u0027s why the function was called |init| before.\n\nOne work around is just calling the |SetTransports_n| directly in other |SetTransports| methods.\n\nBut it doesn\u0027t really matter once my work is done and the BaseChannel don\u0027t have to know about P2P layer transports anymore.",
