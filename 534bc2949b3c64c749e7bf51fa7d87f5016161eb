      "message": "This is very confusing. \n\n1) Using packet_history as a flag to creating RtpSenderEgress. It\u0027s way to implicit.\n2) non_paced_packet_sender is created if we don\u0027t have paced sender in config and we down\u0027t own the history.\n3) config.paced_sender is checked for non_paced_packet_sender, but packetSender is checked for paced_sender_. Why in this way and not packetSender in both cases?\n\nIt\u0027s very hard to understand what is created in what case here.\n\nIt currently might also happen that paced_sender_ is nullptr, if packetSender is null and packet_history is also null (and egress as a result of that), is it expected behavior?\n\nI would instead move that logic to the body of the constructor, where all the cases are explicitly stated with if/switch. The same for the owned history.",
