Usually, DCHECKs are for internal consistency.\n\nThere\u0027s only one other set of tests[1] in WebRTC that checks against !RTC_DCHECK_IS_ON, and that falls back to a death test instead. If we _have_ to go down this belt-and-suspenders route, I think we should test both cases - that the DCHECKs hit with a death test and that it behaves well otherwise with a normal test.\n\n[1] ./rtc_base/strings/string_builder_unittest.cc:60",
