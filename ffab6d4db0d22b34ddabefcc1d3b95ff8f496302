      "message": "While having the remote asking for VP8 makes this test more clear in the way it triggers the fallback, it also hides a regression that I think we need to fix before landing this CL.\n\nThe following should PASS. I suggest a new test for the following steps:\n\n1. pc1 setCodecPreferences(VP8).\n2. pc1 setParameters(L3T3_KEY) -- should work, but with the current CL fails.\n3. Negotiate and have pc2 setCodecPreferences(VP9) before SRD answer.\n4. pc1 is sending VP9 L3T3_KEY.\n\nA test that does all four steps is ideal, but even just doing steps 1 and 2 and asserting that SetParameters does not reject would give enough test coverage IMO.\n\nWe have a separate test that ensures SetParameters() fails if we attempt L3T3_KEY *after* we have negotiated the codecs and rules out VP9 which is Good. But the problem I\u0027m trying to highlight here is that we shouldn\u0027t refuse to do L3T3_KEY *before* we know if pc2 wants VP9 or not.\n\nThis is important for the unidirectional use case IMO because otherwise we have to flip-flop between scalabilityModes we don\u0027t want.",

      "message": "This isn\u0027t a regression in the sense \"used to work, now broken\" but a change in behavior - \"used to fail, now works\".\nStep 2 works with this CL but was rejecting before.\nFollowed by negotiation it results in VP8 with L1T2.\n\nDoing the test you propose requires SDP trickery along the lines of webrtc/protocol/additional-codecs.html\nNot impossible but... somewhat sdp mungy.",
