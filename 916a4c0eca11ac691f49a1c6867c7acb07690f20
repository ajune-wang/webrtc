      "message": "I thought the endpoint that created the m\u003d section would be the one that offer the extensions, and I didn\u0027t realize the other endpoint is allowed to add new extensions, so I made the mistake of thinking [[NegotiatedHeaderExtensions]] would always be a subset of [[HeaderExtensionsToNegotiate]]. Therefore, I had thought that only [[NegotiatedHeaderExtensions]] need be updated in response to setting SDP, but I am open to the idea that we should default to accepting what was offered by default and also update [[HeaderExtensionsToNegotiate]] when SDP offer is set - supporting both the \"remote SDP is adding extensions\" use case and the \"local SDP munging\" use case for backwards compat with apps are using prior to this API existing.",
