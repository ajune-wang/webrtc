      "message": "Hi, sorry for late reply.\nReading the code,\n1) I can\u0027t find that the tie-breaker is surfaced to sdp/JS,\n2) I though that it might be the same if you have several ice transports (i.e not using BUNDLE), but it seems not to be.\n3) It is only using when receiving/sending ice-pings\n\nSummary: I see no reason why it should exist in anywhere except Port and p2p_transport_channel. I therefor suggest letting p2p_transport_channel\ncreating it \"privately\".\n\nOne thing to double check is that there is no scenario in which the tiebreaker changes during the life-time of p2p_transport_channel. I think not, but I suggest double checking.\n\nHow does that sound ? Am I missing something ?",
