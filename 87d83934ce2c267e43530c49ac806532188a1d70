If it doesn\u0027t, or you are not sure please let me know of some docs on how to build the webrtc targets from within a chromium checkout.\n\n- I left in the \"custom_package\" template arg even though it is no longer required because I noticed some comments about a Bazel converter, I suspect that it might need that template arg. If you know that it doesn\u0027t, please let me know and I will remove the template arg. However it does not hurt to keep it since we plan on supporting that for now (only create_srcjar \u003d true will be fully deprecated).",
