      "message": "This change is the first step towards passing the applied input volume to `AnalyzePreProcess()` and deprecating the setter (see the [TODO](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/modules/audio_processing/agc2/input_volume_controller.h;drc\u003d03bccbe62d60d9f40284e5a1c62ee13801e06a6a;l\u003d87)). This CL temporarily makes some tests less readable but I\u0027d prefer changing the tests before changing the code itself. And as said, this is the first step -- there are a few other deprecated helper functions we need to take care of as well if we decide to take this approach.\n\nI\u0027d be happy to hear your thoughts on this!",
