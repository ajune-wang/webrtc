      "message": "Question to reviewers: Now that EVERYTHING is guarded by a sequence checker... do we want to keep the sequence checker in OveruseFrameDetectorResourceAdaptationModule? If the module instances are RTC_GUARDED_BY a sequence checker or task queue, safety would be ensured at usage place - and this class doesn\u0027t even have to care about the existence of sequences. VideoStreamEncoder already protects it with RTC_GUARDED_BY. That said it doesn\u0027t hurt to check proper usage inside this class as well, other than possibly readability.",
