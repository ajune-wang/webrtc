I assume avoiding small fragments was there for a reason too.\n\nWouldn\u0027t a more robust / performant approach be to let the RR scheduler stay on the current stream until the end of a message is seen?\n\nI don\u0027t quite understand how the RR scheduler could move to a different stream when it encountered a too small fragment, but would stay on the current stream when encountering a large message where part has to go into the next packet anyway.\n\n",
