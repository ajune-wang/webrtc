      "message": "This change means that the code is no longer local.\nI.e., the maximum number of channels, and the supported maximum sample rate, is no longer only controlled and self-contained by the AudioBuffer.\n\nAlso, we have a situation where we still have AudioBuffer::kMaxSampleRate, but where kMaxSamplesPerChannel now are specified by audio_util.h. \n\nThey have matching values now as AudioBuffer::kMaxSampleRate\u003dwebrtc::kMaxSampleRate\nbut I think it makes the code a bit more fragile. \nI think this change is ok though if we remove AudioBuffer::kMaxSampleRate or if we add a todo+plan to remove it.",

      "message": "Yes, I\u0027d like to remove the AudioBuffer constant. It\u0027s being used outside the class too, so in the sense that changing it affected implementations outside the class, it wasn\u0027t truly local (assuming you don\u0027t mean the `kMaxSamplesPerChannel` constant itself). Because of that I actually felt that it was more fragile to have more shared definitions of what the max sample rate is. (I know that there are still areas that have their own, more restricted max values).",
