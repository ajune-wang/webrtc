Basically, I think we would need a way to share state between the functions to avoid duplicating the code, and I don\u0027t think shared state is cleaner/easier to read.\n\nI was also considering removing the graph above, since I\u0027m not sure how useful it is.",

      "message": "I think having this amount of shared code is a bad trade off to get line number info. Basically anyone debugging this code will want to read both, in case the bug is a typo in one of the implementations etc. If it\u0027s really required to know which of the functions originated the error you could add a string argument. For the continue issue you could return a bool. If you need to hold state over time a helper class might help.\n\nJust keeping one of the functions is also fine to me.",
