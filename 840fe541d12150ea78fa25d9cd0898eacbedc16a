      "message": "What I am worried in this case, is that we kind of deceive the compile time check into thinking that after the call, the mutex is held, while we do nothing.\n\nI wonder if we should implement this check or do something similar to Chromium (https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:base/synchronization/lock.h;l\u003d38;drc\u003da82378c43085272634cd20f92cfb11a1c65f3897) which has the check in debug builds and not in release builds.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "message": "Changing it to do the run time check only in debug builds makes sense to me (I hadn\u0027t expected abseil\u0027s AssertHeld to be an unconditional check). About naming, should it be consistent with abseil (AssertLocked) or with chromium (AssertAcquired)?\n\nImplementing it for other mutex implementations looks a bit subtle; I did a quick check of pthreads and window\u0027s critical section, and couldn\u0027t find any easy advertised way to do it. So it would need some additional atomic member to record owning thread, with writes protected by the mutex but readable from arbitrary threads.\n\nI think we have reasonable test coverage with abseil\u0027s mutex (but perhaps not on the publicly visible bots; maybe we should add a configuration to do that)? For local tests, I use \n\nrtc_use_absl_mutex \u003d true\ntreat_warnings_as_errors \u003d false\n\nin args.gn.",
