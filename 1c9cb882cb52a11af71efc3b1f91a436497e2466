      "message": "Filtering it out on GetLatestReportBlockData() sounds good to me, but alternatively is there any reason to keep the old blocks around?\n\nFor example when you insert new block upon reception you could also just erase any old blocks that have become obsolete so that they no longer exist.\n\nLet me know what you think about that and if you want me to take another look, otherwise I am happy with he CL as-is. Giving my LGTM.",

      "message": "It seems I was too hasty... some tests failed with the previous approach.\n\nFor some tests comparing time to detect the latest report is not good enough.\nSo I rethink the approach once more time and keeping just the latest report now looks like the safest approach.\n\nHowever I feel a need to add a separate map to keep rtts per remote_ssrc. (In practice most of that functionality is not needed, but... changing api and assumptions callers make is a long road. I\u0027m taking that long road too, but as a separate effort.)\n\nAll tests seems to pass now (patchset#3). Mind taking another look?",
