The owner of the file (AecDumpImpl) also calls Close.\n\nCan we ensure that debug_file_ (including the file_, its only member) is never written to during the lifetime of the task queue? \n\nThis class could have a separate bool, or set debug_file_ \u003d nullptr, to say that it shouldn\u0027t write any more data, instead of calling Close.",
