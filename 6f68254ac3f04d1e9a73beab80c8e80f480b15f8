Comment (and the fact that nothing breaks when you remove it) makes me wonder if there\u0027s something we\u0027ve not implemented here.\n\nThe envisioned scenario was something like\n\n- Negotiate bundles of media sections (A, B) and (C, D)\n- Multiplex SCTP on the (A, B) bundle\n- Stop A and B\n\nIn this case, the SCTP connection wants to be on the (C, D) bundle.\nBut I don\u0027t think anyone is using \u003e 1 bundle groups and stopping a whole bundle group in practice. So perhaps nobody cares?",
