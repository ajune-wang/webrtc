      "message": "A very expensive thing to do for such a small thing. There are reports of calling getStats() or not being the difference between the fan making a sound or not (not sure which application).\nPreferably getStats() should only be called every 5-10 seconds.\n\nRehashing an old conversation, but: Is WebAudio too expensive? There was an issue about exposing different levels directly on MediaStreamTracks (https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/issues/523) but nobody\u0027s owning/driving it.",

      "message": "Yeah, we\u0027re aware :/ unfortunately, it\u0027s not a small thing in a multiway call because we use audio levels to determine the active speaker. 5-10 seconds is far too infrequent.\n\nWe\u0027re using the native API and are looking into less expensive ways of surfacing the audio level.",
