      "message": "Why do we ignore values greater than 20? Do we suspect the client that pushes this value might be buggy? IMHO, a value of 50 might be ill-advised, but it\u0027s up to experimentation to show it, right? I could imagine an ultra-low-bandwidth scenario where someone might really intend it. Or am I missing something?",

      "message": "The motivation of limit this to 20 ms is mostly because this adds extra network delay in case a packet is lost. This 20 ms is set to allow waiting for the \"missing packet\" if the packet was just out of order, in such scenario, we expect it just late for a couple of milliseconds.  \nThis field trial is not used at this moment. Feel free to experiment with this.",

      "message": "I understand the motivation for the experiment and think it makes sense. I am just wondering if it makes sense to prevent someone interested in experimenting with delay\u003d50 from doing so, by hard-coding a limit of 20 to the experiment. I understand that some hard-coded maximum value is good practice, but I wonder if 20 might not be a bit too low. Would it not make sense to set that hard-coded value to e.g. 500ms? If values above, say, 40ms are unreasonable, it\u0027s the responsibility of the experiment controller to keep values below that.",
