      "message": "It seems to still fail.... the right solution to those issues is (I think) to make a mock that mocks everything and put it into api/test, and let anyone who wants to write their own mock inherit from that rather than the abstract class. That way, nobody outside webrtc needs to update when we add new virtual functions.\n\n(and that lesson needs to be applied in a lot of places, we\u0027ve got tons of that kind of trouble both in g3 and in chrome)",
