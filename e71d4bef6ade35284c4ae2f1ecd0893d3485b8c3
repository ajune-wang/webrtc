      "message": "Hm. According to hbos@ this is actually indication that you caught a real bug - those two pointers are supposed to be compared for equality; if they point to two different strings, something\u0027s wrong.\n\nThis instance should probably have been written RTC_DCHECK(a \u003d\u003d b) rather than using the _EQ operator, to make it plain that this was the intent.\n\nWhat happens if one of the arguments is a non-null-terminated string?",

(Comparing two static C strings with same address is fine).\n\nAccording to https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/webrtc/api/stats/rtc_stats.h;drc\u003d44798fcb6d921c4a8fee8331289021a3b25b4450;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d1;l\u003d88 , current uses of `cast_to` are `cast_to\u003cRTCTransportStats\u003e`, `cast_to\u003cRTCCodecStats\u003e`, `cast_to\u003cRTCOutboundRTPStreamStats\u003e` and `cast_to\u003cRTCInboundRTPStreamStats\u003e`, all of which is fine.\n\nI\u0027m trying to `cast_to\u003cRTCMediaSourceStats\u003e` from https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/281300/3. This is because `RTCAudioSourceStats` and `RTCVideoSourceStats` have the same `type()` but different number of members. To do that, I need to compare the content equality of the C string, not the address equality.",
