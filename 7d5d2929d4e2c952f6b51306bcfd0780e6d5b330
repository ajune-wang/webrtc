It\u0027s done in this test code:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/test/encoder_settings.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026q\u003dwebrtc/test/encoder_settings.cc\u0026l\u003d64\n\nAlso I think it\u0027s overridden in a downstream client.\n\nI can also make these changes if I break any tests due to changes I make in lower layers. Either way.",

      "message": "Are you thinking of filling in true as a short term hard coded solution? I think that makes sense so I can make the changes in the lower layers. Maybe add a TODO?\n\nTo connect things I added simulcast_layers to the VideoEncoderConfig, so you can update which simulcast layers are active in CreateVideoEncoderConfig. Then the encoder_config passed into this function can be used to update the streams.active properly. I think you saw that CL, I just wanted to make sure you knew that\u0027s why I added that simulcast_layers in there.",
