Because if you do it here it will only be call for packets that form a full frame.",

      "message": "WDYT about moving this to the RtpVideoStreamReceiver? In the RtpVideoStreamReceiver::OnReceivedPayloadData function a PacketBuffer::Packet is created. Before calling PacketBuffer::InsertPacket you could interpolate and set_absolute_capture_time on the packet. In PacketBuffer::AssembleFrame you could then simply copy (or move) all the RtpPacketInfo into a RtpPacketInfos::vector_type.\n\nI think that would be cleaner, to keep concerns as separate as possible.",
