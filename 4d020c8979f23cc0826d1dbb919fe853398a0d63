      "message": "Hi, tommi@, \n\nI\u0027ve been uloading my first commit to the webrtc repo to fix the warning of the clang check. I think that the StringBuilder class is a class that does not need to be exposed to the outside. So, I would like to propose preventing headers from being exposed to the outside, like Blink\u0027s INSIDE_BLINK. If I am approaching it incorrectly, please correct me. Thanks.\n\nFYI, Chromium bots for this change will work well with https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5329549 but I\u0027m not sure how to make the build with the CL over the repo.",
